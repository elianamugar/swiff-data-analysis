Crossing the color line - healing from the past,Italy,Sabrina Onana ,Documentary,"While the political-media discourses focus on the ""migration crisis"", the policies linked to it or the news events involving ""immigrants"", in the second part of the docu-film ""Crossing the color line - healing from the past"" the Italian Afro-descendants express themselves in the first person on these (rendered) controversial issues. Carriers of a migratory background, and therefore of a double inheritance, but also of the immigrant's stigma for their phenotypic aspect in a country where national identity and ""whiteness"" are still inseparable in the collective imagination, the ""Afro-Italians"" - whose presence is not yet normalized - are often perceived as disturbers of the ethnic-cultural balance of their country, which questions their Italian character and considers them as an exogenous presence that must ""integrate"" and not ""communitarise"", or '' go back to your own country ''. Beyond categories and theories, this documentary wants to offer the possibility of directly accessing the stories, concerns and needs of a minority whose experience allows us to understand the national anchoring of global social movements such as Afro-feminism. or anti-racism, informing us at the same time on the specificities of the Italian context. Past and present are intertwined through the experiences of the people interviewed and the historical excursus on Italian and European colonial history, allowing us to understand not only how the Other, the racialized African, came to be created over the centuries, but also the way in which this perception continues today to structure common sense and individual experiences. In a hyper-connected and globalized world, is it still possible to oppose a ""We"" to a ""You"" in an antagonistic way? In any case, it is urgent to understand the contemporary consequences of a collective past that has left a mark on individual and national consciences. A sign that distorts relationships with oneself and with others and from which, even today, people try to heal.",

According to researchers, the amount of snowfall in the Alps has decreased by more than 53% as of 2023. These projections put the future of ski resorts located at low and medium altitudes, as well as those without artificial snow systems, in greater danger.  249 Italian ski resorts were closed down in recent years. 138 remain temporarily shut down. To rebuild the ski lifts in these locations, however, politicians continue to spend millions of euros. The general feeling seems to be that a snow-free winter is likely to happen in the far future, rather than something that has already happened.

The protagonists skied in places that once were white ski slopes and which today have turned into arid, yellow slopes.

I watch as she seemingly takes every bit of it in stride, never wavering in her love and dedication to motherhood. Myeloma on the Low Plains, a short documentary film accompanied by photographs, is the result of my need to document her life, thoughts, art, and childhood while I still have the chance—my attempt to control some part of the situation that confiscated most of my teen years. Most importantly, it is an attempt at making her live forever.  Multiple myeloma affects approximately 10,000 people in the US each year. With its diagnosis comes an altered life path replete with doctor’s appointments, fatigue, and lots of introspection—creating a drastic shift in family dynamics and existence—all to salvage a life that will never return to its former state but is not without promise. I hope to underscore my mother’s physical and internal struggles as well as a new kind of appreciation for life, which is manifest on her face and in her stance. My film and photographs were made 6 years into her diagnosis, serving as a reflection of experiences both past and present.",

However, toward the end of the recording, her grandmother calls ......  BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH Xiaoyan (Zhang Xiaoyan) 25 years old Unemployed, introverted, and sensitive. Growing up in the countryside, Xiaoyan was driven by traditional thinking to take three consecutive civil service examinations but failed them all. Without financial resources, unable to return to her hometown and bring honor to their ancestors, the pressure of life eventually makes Xiao Yan have the idea of giving up her life ...... Grandma (Zhang Xiuqing) 70 years old A peasant, bright, gruff, and not very good at expressing his inner emotions. After Xiao Yan grows up and leaves home, Zhang Xiuqing lives with an old turtle in the yard, knowing that she finds out that her time is coming ...... Staff 40 years old  Cemetery worker. The pick-up and drop-off driver at North Hill Cemetery is round and fat. He looks a bit mean but is a warm-hearted person.  STORY OVERVIEW Xiao Yan is ready to commit suicide after failing yet another public exam. But when Xiao Yan records a farewell video that she is ""busy with work"", her grandmother calls and asks Xiao Yan to come and take a special photo of herself. After this photo session, Xiao Yan finally opens herself up to truly observe life. However, after a thoughtless inquiry, Xiao Yan discovers that her grandmother, like herself, is preparing for her eternal goodbye with a well-intentioned lie. In the end, after a mistimed farewell in the cemetery forest, Xiao Yan decides to overcome the odds and live with determination, ushering in a new life with her grandmother's final care.  THIS FILM EXPLORES ·Faced with failure, Xiao Yan doesn't know how to choose the right path ·How a grandmother finds a way to say goodbye to her granddaughter when death is inevitable ·Does a lie protect the one you love  EXPLANATION OF STORY IDEAS It is a story of redemption, built on the lie of love. Xiao Yan is still young, but cowardice in the face of failure makes her choose to run away. Deprived of her spiritual strength, she gives up on herself, and she ""dies"" in internal conflict. At the same time, grandmother's body comes to an end. However, the strength of the heart makes granny embrace the world with gentleness, which in turn influences Xiaoyan. The redemption of the story is not only the renewal of Xiao Yan but also the 'renewal' of the grandmother. All things wither, just go forward with love and the earth will remember all.  BACKGROUND When I was away at school, my family called me and told me that my grandmother had passed away but I didn't have to go home. They considered if I went back home, I would miss my studies. After my initial shock and disbelief, I realized that in this time of technological development and information explosion, ""love"" was the biggest contradiction. They are afraid that their children will be upset, and then children will not be able to catch up with their peers. Most of all, they will cause them trouble. But young people are in a hurry to achieve success, searching for their identity day after day, forgetting their hometowns, forgetting the laughter of their childhood, forgetting the love of those around them, and forgetting the power of love. In this story, I hope to show the persistence and confusion of the traveler who is away from home and the longing and tenderness of the elders for the traveler. I hope to further explore the power of nature and the heart contained in the cycle of birth, old age, sickness, and death.  REFLECTION Compared to my school assignments, this short film about my grandmother was my first formal production, and my first time being a director. In this new endeavor, I also discovered my shortcomings in myself. Due to the impact of the policy, the originally chosen location could not be used and had to be temporarily changed to another city. Although the change of location resulted in shooting scenes that were not up to my expectations, I believe I have gained more experience in the creative process. At the same time, as undergraduate teaching does not involve much hands-on training in filmmaking, I spent a lot of time confirming the length of each shot with the cameraman, which took up a lot of my downtime. In the time to come, I will try to submit my film to the Young Independent Art Film Festival of Strangers. At the same time, I hope to refine this short film after further study and submit it to international film festivals like the GOLDEN SPARROW INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL to get more people's comments and feedback.",

This was when I visited Gulbarg Society and decided to narrow down my topic to the massacre that haunts this place to date.  I used just a SONY handycam and my phone mic to make this film and worked on a very tight budget. The treatment however aided me in translating the chaos and helplessness that I felt making this film.  Children guide me through this film innocently taking me on an emotional journey while I document what is left of the aftermath.  They sing, joke around, and make comments about what they understand. I let the children talk to me. We had long conversations where I mostly listened.   Now, you’re part of the conversation… ",

Front Line Brazil,Brazil,Elder,Fraga,"""FRONTLINE BRAZIL"". The film team followed the health professionals during the peak of the pandemic in Brazil in the first wave, the day to day in three Covid-19 ICUs in the city of Santos - SP, between the months of March and November 2020. The idea of the documentary is to give voice to the health professionals who are fighting to save lives in the midst of the pandemic. Health professionals from all sectors were heard, with moving accounts of the daily struggle with patients in serious condition. The film also registered the beginning of the pandemic in China and the countries affected by Covid-19 in Asia and Europe through the lens of international correspondent Marcelo Espíndola, passing through São Paulo, Santos, Manaus, and Pará. Reports from doctors in places where the health system collapsed, always trying to understand the pandemic from the medical point of view, such as Dr. Roberto Zeballos (Immunologist), Dr. Gustavo Pasquarelli (Infectologist), and 23 other health professionals. The film portrays the moment when the world and Brazil stopped, the lives of doctors, nurses, and psychologists who are in the front line, and who, besides the physical and emotional wear, were isolated and deprived of daily contact with their families.

Vaani (Voice),India,Namya,Chadha,"The film is inspired by Vaani School and Research Centre, Meerut, which is a school for deaf children. It's about the dreams and aspirations of children with disabilities and the role of 'special' school teachers as interlocutors in helping them pursue their dreams. It was challenging for the teachers to build trust in communicating at first. Gradually, the children began to share their problems with the teachers. In the film, the teachers describe how they adapt to their students' world and learn about their hearing disability and level to understand their language. The children share their problems they encounter in the outside world. The film also highlights the speech therapy which children must necessarily take. The speech therapist demonstrates different categories and hearing levels concerning interpreting language. These motivated students share their favorite food, hobbies, likes and dislikes and what they want to be when they grow up. The teachers feel that sign language is essential and, if not, it is important to use audio/visual aid to improve the learning approach. Beyond education, they believe these students have an eye for creativity and can do well in the future. They encourage  parents to let their children come to school. The staff and teachers of Vaani School talk about their initiatives for the better future of their students and how they strive to deliver the best education for their children's success. I chose a feel-good, motivating and inspiring genre for my film. I wanted to hear the story of their relationship with the students and their history. These teachers take up the role of guardians for the children. At the same time, interestingly so, the film reveals how the teachers resort to ableist terminology and language while working with deaf children. The school is attempting to create an accessible environment for the children by installing visual aids for students and teachers to teach and learn. In a society where parents are unaware of deaf and hearing impairment, these teachers encourage parents to let their children come to school.  ",

Lost in Tartarus,Austria,Elham,Hadian,"In an underground the sandman is struggling to find a way out but he just forced to unending effort and bare repetition.

As a punishment to the crime, Sisyphus was exile to the deep abyss place named TARTARUS, forever to try to roll a large stone to the top of a mountain, which no matter how many times he nearly succeeded in his attempt, it would always roll back to the bottom.  Albert Camus, in his 1942 essay The Myth of Sisyphus, saw Sisyphus as personifying the absurdity of human life, but Camus concludes ""one must imagine Sisyphus happy"" as ""The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart."" Camus sees Sisyphus as the absurd hero who lives life to the fullest, hates death, and is condemned to a meaningless task. Instead of despairing, Camus imagined Sisyphus defiantly meeting his fate as he walks down the hill to begin rolling the rock again. And even if the daily struggles of our lives sometimes seem equally repetitive and absurd, we still give them significance and value by embracing them as our own.",https://vimeo.com/708580064

Swaying Dress ,China,ting,zhou,"The story is based on the eve of the high school prom, where three girls prepare for the prom together. It shows that through resolving conflicts and misunderstandings, the adolescent girls encourage and support each other, and eventually grow up in different degrees, understand the meaning of friendship and find the direction of their future. On the other hand, the main characters are three representative girls, showing the explicit and implicit constraints and pressures that women face in the process of growing up from their families and society, as well as how they break with traditional ideas, find their self-worth and complete their transformation. The “Swaying"" shows the inner world of adolescent girls and their confusion in the process of growing up, while the “Dress"" can be used as a symbol of femininity and echoes the important element of the dress in the film. The conflict between mother and daughter at the beginning of the story shows the complexity and alienation of the relationship between mother and daughter in a patriarchal society. The character of ""Xia Yue"" rebels against this. ""Due to her special upbringing, Jian Tong appears as an unconventional girl, whose confidence, determination and spontaneity have a profound impact on her friends and can be seen as a leader. ""Yang Xiaohan"" faces problems common to many adolescent girls: anxiety about her figure and appearance, emotional distress, and a low sense of self-worth due to her parents' unreasonable upbringing, which she solves with the help of her friends.   2. Synopsis. On the eve of their graduation, the three girls resolve the conflicts between themselves and their environment, overcome their misunderstandings and finally grow up.   3. Character design. Jian Tong: 18 years old, comes from a single-parent family, lives with her mother, is a maverick, doesn't care about the opinions of others and has clear goals and plans for her future. She is a feminist and dreams of becoming a fashion designer, designing clothes for different types of girls, hoping they will build up their confidence in every aspect. Xia Yue: 18 years old, lively and lovely, comes from a traditional Chinese family, wants to study abroad but is not understood by her parents. She is guided by Jian Tong to firm up her ideas and convinces her parents by her own efforts. She is confused about her feelings for Yang Xiaohan, and with the help of Jian tong, she finally comes to her senses. Yang Xiaohan: 17 years old, slightly chubby, very unsure of herself growing up due to long term suppression by her parents, anxious about her body shape and low self-worth when faced with someone she has a crush on. Song Yang: 18 years old, gay, outstanding in appearance, Yang Xiaohan's crush, enjoys Yang Xiaohan's goodwill and does not tell her that he is gay. Xia Yue's mother: 40-45 years old, teacher, relatively thin, with more pronounced wrinkles between her eyebrows and eyes and a quick temper.   4. Style. The whole is presented in a fresh, soft tone, leaning towards a film documentary feel. The conflict scene at the beginning adds a slight sense of tension, and then the scene changes to show the transition from dark to light.   5. Video. The film presents a story about youth and growing up, with an overall lively style and warm tones; it is mostly composed with people; the park and school corridor scenes have many POV perspectives and close-ups of the characters' faces to express emotions. Reference films: The Sea Maiden, Over Spring (the POV of the female protagonist on the cruise ship is used as a reference for the school corridor scenes), and the shooting angle at the end of Miao Miao (not tonal).   6. Art. Xia Yue's home is a traditional Chinese design with elements such as wooden furniture and porcelain to show the environment in which she grew up; Jian Tong's home is decorated in a modern, minimalist style, with mostly solid-coloured furniture and low saturation to create a cool atmosphere, requiring elements such as needlework, mannequins, fabrics and design sketches to fit her dream of being a fashion designer. The streets are lined with greenery and full of fireworks, in keeping with the ""small town"" setting. The dress shop, located next to the street, is old and the dresses on display are out of date and not in keeping with the aesthetic of young girls. The characters' clothing styles are more casual for Jantong, cuter for Xia Yue, and black, loose clothing for Yang Xiaohan at the beginning, reflecting her lack of self-confidence, but her dressing style changes significantly in the final airport scene.   7. Sound. Background sounds such as cicadas chirping in summer, wind blowing leaves, car horns honking by the street and the roar of planes taking off. The scenes in Jantong's living room have the faint sound of a television playing as background sound.   8. Editing. Linear editing, with flashbacks to the school corridor scenes using jump cuts without too many transitions and natural transitions between transitions. In the first scene, the characters quarrel, and the close editing of the switch in perspective creates a sense of tension when the characters are in conflict.",

Falcatrua - Joaquim (até Quando?)  ,Brazil,Rodrigo,Piteco,"The song chosen to be the first music video for Falcatrua's new work is Joaquim (Até Quando?), a song that asks in an ironic tone: How long will this factory of martyrs go on? Chico Mendes, Zumbi, Dorothy Stang, Amarildo Marielle, our own blood? The echo of this question was transformed into images that are shuffled in the cosmopolitan rhythm of the capitals. A camera that floats among the green of the trees in the municipal park of Belo Horizonte, hovering over people, to launch itself into the gray asphalt of Avenida Afonso Pena, bringing us face to face with a face that we only see from the bottom up: the face of the statue of Tiradentes (Joaquim José da Silva Xavier). In a whirlpool of imagery references from common situations, Rodrigo Oliveira (Piteco), director of the new video clip, creates a mosaic of images that are amalgamating in the rhythm of a virtuous drone flight. The drone has become a kind of element of the new urban “fauna” in big cities around the world and we can already feel its effects in audiovisual productions, with its floating and colossal shots. This was Piteco's starting point to conceive a script with the dynamics of a sequence shot that draws a vehement succession of images in a panoramic flight through the center of our Belo Horizonte catching the band members (Miglio, Jovem, Cesco and Fred ) in dense everyday situations, around the symbolic statue of Tiradentes. In the words of Japanese film critic Souzousareta Geijutsuka “A daring and intense music video that holds the viewer in place with its precise rhythm and careful photography and art. Highlight for the skill of those who operate the drone”.",

They show a feminine way of living religion, where the art of appearance is a pillar.

The images show how they preserve their traditions while adapting to the social and societal changes that have taken place over the last twenty years on their small 'French' island in the middle of the Indian Ocean.

The Tarango Ravine - Mexico City,Mexico,Alejandro Tubal,Garcia,"This documentary is a journey of discovery of the Barranca de Tarango, a precious and precious wildlife refuge within Mexico City. We will enter its trails and travel through forests, rivers, lagoons, and grasslands. Here we will get to know its fauna and flora, from the small and unique left-handed hummingbird to the Cacomixtle and the magnificent holm oaks so important in the valley of Mexico. From an environmental point of view the conservation of the Barranca is of exceptional value and needs to be preserved. Being in the centre of a megalopolis, with easy and free access, it also has a singular pedagogical value both at school and academic level. We will be able to witness how nature, with the collaboration of neighbours, volunteers and environmental organisations, fights against urban development interests, arson, and pollution. Tarango shows us all that a wild place in the middle of a megalopolis has to offer: a natural space to disconnect from the stress, noise, and pollution of the city. An area that brings unique environmental benefits to one of the largest cities in the world. Day by day ""Las Barrancas de Tarango"" continues to lose ground to uncontrolled and corrupt urbanisation. Despite having been declared an ""Area of Environmental Value"" several times, its protection and implementation has suffered territorial defeats caused by private urban interests. Its future is uncertain and there are fears about its deterioration, especially the loss of soil capacity due to intentional fires. Climate change with its extreme droughts does not help either. The beauty of this peculiar ravine is still unknown to most of the inhabitants of Mexico City and even of the surrounding neighbourhoods. Without greater citizen participation and collaboration, the Barrancas de Tarango are in danger.  ""We are responsible for how we treat our green spaces. Tarango speaks to us, it is up to us to listen and defend this magnificent lung of nature"". ",

With traditional livelihoods and Inuit culture under threat, people must battle ever changing elements through long, dark, arctic winters, and adapt to the impact climate change has had on their way of life.  Playing On The Edge follows a small community in Northern Greenland who look to the sun and football for hope. Living with people who were born and raised in the town, we see how people’s lives are beginning to change irreversibly.

TRAVESSIA ,Brazil,Alexandre,Maciel,"""Travessia"" is a contemporary dance performance that revives the Black diaspora, from the horrors of the water-covered dungeon - the slave ship - drifting through to the present day. It has been 134 years of freedom, but Black people are still chained to many shackles in Brazil. The Black, poor, and favela-dwelling people are the concrete result of the Brazilian structural racism, fostered day after day for years of injustice and non-reparations. Permeated by poetry and video art, the performance presents phases of the African population's trajectory since their arrival in Brazil, in the water-covered dungeons of slave ships, to the contemporaneity of Afro-descendants and the false idea of freedom that runs through their existences. ""Travessia"" is a cry of lament, a deafening noise, a danced illustration of an important part of our people's untold history. Chains and lashes live within us, seas and oceans run through our veins. Tears mix with salt water, and no one hears us. There is no help from here. We have lost ourselves in inhumanity, we have lost ourselves from God. Here in my heart, there is the longing for my motherland. I carefully guard the entity that lives in this cheapened flesh, in the memory of where I came from and what we were - Kings and Queens.",

"Street Chess; Community, Care, and Competition",United States,Eugene,Yoo,"When I first came to Washington Square Park to play the chess hustlers, I wasn’t sure what to expect. I originally thought that people played street chess for the games, but I soon realized that street chess revolved around stories and community. One hustler told me about how he grew up in Turkey as a dual hairdresser and chess expert, another that he was a rising rapper with a new album dropping soon, and another that he worked on Wall Street and came to play chess on the weekends simply for the joy of it. Before long, the wildly interesting stories were what kept me coming back to the street chess table. I learned that the “chess hustlers” were not hustlers at all, but artists. Their profession might not be lucrative, but they chose to immerse themselves in a unique culture centered around a common passion. Interacting with this culture made me curious about how people build and give meaning to creative forms of sociality in urban settings like Washington Square Park. The street chess community transcends age and race; it is inclusive of everyone who loves chess and even those who don’t. I started journaling about my experiences interacting with street chess culture, which eventually turned into an ethnography and film project sharing the story of chess hustlers with others, breaking stereotypes about them and encouraging readers to more carefully consider this unique community. The experience certainly confirmed for me that you cannot properly study a group of people without interacting with them. ",

This project was inspired by my own experience as a sibling of an older sister with Down syndrome.  ‘Glass children’ is a term that has been used to refer to the siblings of people with a disability. The ‘glass’ metaphor depicts how we tend to see right through them and focus only on the person with the disability. When we speak of disability issues, the perspective of the typically developing sibling is often overlooked. This documentary has given ‘glass siblings’ a platform to reveal their innermost thoughts and feelings and I hope it becomes a resource of support for other siblings.",

I Wasn't Afraid,"Palestine, State of",Sawsan,Ahmad,"'I Wasn't Afraid' is a 2016 short film made by Palestinian children aged just 10-12 years old at an animation class in the town of Beit Furik, West Bank. Utilizing stop-motion animation, it was entirely written, animated, soundtracked and voice acted by the children on a shoestring budget, and it represents their first ever attempt at committing their ideas to film. The story is narrated by Ali, a disabled child from Gaza, who exemplifies the strength of spirit which is required to keep going about your daily life in a city under siege. As Ali utters ""I'm not afraid"", we are shown war planes flying over his vibrant homeland, leaving ruin in their wake. Imitating the outside world, he makes a paper airplane and throws it to the sky, longing for freedom, and dreaming of a better life, as he watches the Gaza skyline outlined in technicolor. As the bombing edges ever closer to his home, he makes his way to his mother for comfort, and lays down his crutches as she soothes him to sleep. In his slumber, we are shown just how brave Ali is.  ""I'm not afraid"" - Ali repeats, as his world quickly becomes a surreal and abstract wonderland. In his dreams he can be friends with anyone, he lives a life not limited by his disability, and he's free to move wherever he likes – but these are only fantasies for many young Palestinians. His mind conjures lions and tigers - a metaphorical representation of the massive challenges which he faces in his life - which present no threat to him in the dreamworld which his imagination has created. He tames the lion and rides it to the occupied city of Baysan, a place which he may never see, and in this moment it's clear that all he wants is to be free. This is all that any child wants, a basic human right, and so despite the resilience which young Ali, and all Palestinians living in the region are required to have at every moment in order to function and carry on living, 'I Wasn't Afraid' leaves the viewer asking – why should a child need to be so strong?",

Anxiety has become so common these days that even the youngest minds are prone to it.   The film possesses  the essential cinematic feel to communicate the uncertainty of the protagonist. It nurtures the social stigma associated with the mental scars inflicted upon the mind. The film stresses on the general anxiety arising from obsessive and compulsive overthinking and self-scrutiny of one's emotional state. It provides a vivid visualization of the transcendic revolutions of the human mind, often caught in the endless loops of thoughts. No matter how hard one wishes or tries, at times it can be a herculean effort to escape from getting caught in the cobwebs of recurring thoughts.  ""Where is my red tie"" is a conversation with our senses and offers no unnecessary preaching. ",

Especially with the presence of many areas in Egypt that are full of different types of resident and migratory birds.  And raising awareness of the importance of birds in maintaining the ecological balance and not over hunting them.  The stories within the film are many and varied. Each character has their own story, but there is one inner link that connects all the characters in the film to communicate a certain idea or message that becomes clear to the viewer at the end of the film.  It's the passion!  Which prompts any person to do what he loves, even if he is a stranger to society or there are obstacles in his life that may prevent him from doing so.  It's the inner message of the movie, to go after what you love and be loved.  And the link between the freedom and enthusiasm of birds and those characters who love what they do and leave their basic fields, and a sentence appears at the end of the film that summarizes this and its content, which is ""Be like a bird in your dream""",

The idea of the film arose when my mother, after another message from the military in one of the telegram groups, read that Iranian shahed-drones were flying to the Kyiv region from Russia. A friend called her in a panic, they began to discuss the possible horror, but literally after 20 minutes they were already laughing together at some kind of joke. I realized that my thoughts run like deer in my head in the same way, not only in adults. Thoughts and different emotions replace each other at the speed of light. Especially when it comes to Ukrainians. What do we all think about during the war?  Is it possible to show a stream of consciousness? Can you make a movie about this? I asked my mom to help me with the idea of making a film. She wrote a post - a request on Facebook, where she asked her friends to write her thoughts for the last 5 minutes. The result came out stunning. 15 people from 8 to 62 years old responded immediately and shared what they think. All that remains for me is to put these thoughts into a script and film them at Kyiv and Brovary locations.   So, in the frame there is a plant for the production of ordinary household vacuum cleaners bombed by Russian missiles in the summer of 2022, a residential building and a nearby business center blown up by Iranian shaheeds-drones, the entrance to a school during a blackout across the country after Russian shelling. I hope that after watching the film it will become a little clearer what the Ukrainians in the rear think during the war with Russia. ",
MUSIC VIDEO - Sing For The Climate - Malta Edition 2021,Malta,DAVID,MICALLEF,"San Andrea School launched a music video: Sing For the Climate - Do It Now! This forms part of an international campaign launched by Belgian TV presenter Nic Balthazar who had presented the project to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change aka The Paris Agreement (COP21).  Our official contribution as Malta is somewhat of a relaunch of this initiative as the world struggles out of Covid-19. This music video took a totally different dimension as Project Maleth kindly joined forces and offered to transmit this video LIVE from Outer Space from the International Space Centre.  Maltese biomedical scientist Prof Joseph Borg conducted the first-ever Maltese biomedical research remotely using a Biocube. Our video was loaded on the same Biocube. The video was downlinked from the International Space Station and transmitted live on Saturday 18th September 2021.  Prof Joseph Borg and Nic Balthazar attended the Online Launch on 17th July 2021 that was organised for the San Andrea School Community. Right from the outset, Nic put the whole audience into perspective as he joined in whilst on-site filming the natural disasters presently ravaging the regions of Belgium and the neighbouring countries.  On Wednesday 27th October 2021, the video won the Public Vote at the 1st Edition of the Malta Climate Action Awards.  The video is also being put into perspective of all the expectations of the UN's -  Glasgow's COP26 (Sun, Oct 31, 2021 – Fri, Nov 12, 2021).   See attached Press Article and Links.

Swaying Dress ,China,ting,zhou,"The story is based on the eve of the high school prom, where three girls prepare for the prom together. It shows that through resolving conflicts and misunderstandings, the adolescent girls encourage and support each other, and eventually grow up in different degrees, understand the meaning of friendship and find the direction of their future. On the other hand, the main characters are three representative girls, showing the explicit and implicit constraints and pressures that women face in the process of growing up from their families and society, as well as how they break with traditional ideas, find their self-worth and complete their transformation. The “Swaying"" shows the inner world of adolescent girls and their confusion in the process of growing up, while the “Dress"" can be used as a symbol of femininity and echoes the important element of the dress in the film. The conflict between mother and daughter at the beginning of the story shows the complexity and alienation of the relationship between mother and daughter in a patriarchal society. The character of ""Xia Yue"" rebels against this. ""Due to her special upbringing, Jian Tong appears as an unconventional girl, whose confidence, determination and spontaneity have a profound impact on her friends and can be seen as a leader. ""Yang Xiaohan"" faces problems common to many adolescent girls: anxiety about her figure and appearance, emotional distress, and a low sense of self-worth due to her parents' unreasonable upbringing, which she solves with the help of her friends.   2. Synopsis. On the eve of their graduation, the three girls resolve the conflicts between themselves and their environment, overcome their misunderstandings and finally grow up.   3. Character design. Jian Tong: 18 years old, comes from a single-parent family, lives with her mother, is a maverick, doesn't care about the opinions of others and has clear goals and plans for her future. She is a feminist and dreams of becoming a fashion designer, designing clothes for different types of girls, hoping they will build up their confidence in every aspect. Xia Yue: 18 years old, lively and lovely, comes from a traditional Chinese family, wants to study abroad but is not understood by her parents. She is guided by Jian Tong to firm up her ideas and convinces her parents by her own efforts. She is confused about her feelings for Yang Xiaohan, and with the help of Jian tong, she finally comes to her senses. Yang Xiaohan: 17 years old, slightly chubby, very unsure of herself growing up due to long term suppression by her parents, anxious about her body shape and low self-worth when faced with someone she has a crush on. Song Yang: 18 years old, gay, outstanding in appearance, Yang Xiaohan's crush, enjoys Yang Xiaohan's goodwill and does not tell her that he is gay. Xia Yue's mother: 40-45 years old, teacher, relatively thin, with more pronounced wrinkles between her eyebrows and eyes and a quick temper.   4. Style. The whole is presented in a fresh, soft tone, leaning towards a film documentary feel. The conflict scene at the beginning adds a slight sense of tension, and then the scene changes to show the transition from dark to light.   5. Video. The film presents a story about youth and growing up, with an overall lively style and warm tones; it is mostly composed with people; the park and school corridor scenes have many POV perspectives and close-ups of the characters' faces to express emotions. Reference films: The Sea Maiden, Over Spring (the POV of the female protagonist on the cruise ship is used as a reference for the school corridor scenes), and the shooting angle at the end of Miao Miao (not tonal).   6. Art. Xia Yue's home is a traditional Chinese design with elements such as wooden furniture and porcelain to show the environment in which she grew up; Jian Tong's home is decorated in a modern, minimalist style, with mostly solid-coloured furniture and low saturation to create a cool atmosphere, requiring elements such as needlework, mannequins, fabrics and design sketches to fit her dream of being a fashion designer. The streets are lined with greenery and full of fireworks, in keeping with the ""small town"" setting. The dress shop, located next to the street, is old and the dresses on display are out of date and not in keeping with the aesthetic of young girls. The characters' clothing styles are more casual for Jantong, cuter for Xia Yue, and black, loose clothing for Yang Xiaohan at the beginning, reflecting her lack of self-confidence, but her dressing style changes significantly in the final airport scene.   7. Sound. Background sounds such as cicadas chirping in summer, wind blowing leaves, car horns honking by the street and the roar of planes taking off. The scenes in Jantong's living room have the faint sound of a television playing as background sound.   8. Editing. Linear editing, with flashbacks to the school corridor scenes using jump cuts without too many transitions and natural transitions between transitions. In the first scene, the characters quarrel, and the close editing of the switch in perspective creates a sense of tension when the characters are in conflict.",

Walking By The River Front,India,Soumya,Barik,"The relevance of heritage as an essential component of place-making within the urbanscape is evolving across global cities. Understanding heritage values of places, buildings, people and a host of other cohorts, has given way to newly emerging dimensions in research. A consistently growing concern is around the everydayness of heritage, which essentially links people and places in a more intensified and binding manner, to unearth the emotions, sense of ownership and belongingness of citizens, around tangible and intangible heritage. The idea behind this study is to uncover the everydayness of the Kolkata’s riverfront heritage, particularly with reference to migrant communities. The relevance of the study is grounded in the UNESCO’s increasing thrust upon heritage being explored through the medium of communities. Specifically, this project aims to address the intangible and tangible nature of diaspora heritage, with the long term aim of ensuring all citizens (including the poor, displaced and disadvantaged) have equal access to and participation in a city life, which is safe, secure, inclusive, healthy and desirable. Working with diaspora groups and locally-based community enterprises we have curated and co-developed a heritage walk to encourage the public to engage in walking and talking the diaspora city, learning about its people, history and traditions. We now want to attain our objective of engaging a wide audience of new, concerned and interested citizens.   The heritage walk takes us through the “Ghats” of river Hugli, the cradle of the city of Calcutta (now Kolkata) through the narration of oral histories and locating of the sites as mentioned and valued by the migrant community. Kolkata’s riverfront history is etched in Manasamangal Kavya (that mentions the Chitteswari Temple that still stands), an economy evolving with influx from the country-side and foreign lands well before Job Charnock arrived in late 17th Century. We put together, narratives of local residents and people connected to the riverfront in numerous ways, knowledge of the locations gathered from archival material and discussions with history experts. Eventually we have achieved a better understanding of the wider benefits of heritage conservation (including increased tourism). This work will ultimately promote cultural tourism and enable a roadmap and long-term vision for heritage planning to foster the development of equitable, inclusive, environmentally and socially beneficial cities in India.",

The destruction and oblivion created by the same blank spaces express the dark side of death, the disappearance. The signs and sites belonging to the concept of mysticism in Islam that lives in the village reminded me of the metaphysical side of death and the fear of the obscure.  Ever since I met with the concept of death, my desire to understand was killing me, and Lübbey is an appropriate place with characteristics that meet this expression in me spatially.  In other words, Lübbey is the intersection point of mortem, as the land that people fear entering and the sky they long to go nested together in the movie's last scene.

Some like it silence,China,ting,zhou," The subjects of these films are sensitive and focus on the problems of today so they sound a strong alarm. The girl called So-won in Hope is in pain yet she is lucky as the support from family and society helps her through the darkness. Like So-won, the character Gu Pan from ‘Some like it silence’ has no power to speak and they both try to break through darkness to search for light and the possibility to climb up. “Climbing up” here refers not to success but to break dark and defined things in life. The character in my short film can be defined as those who have no resources or power. They have no critical resources in this society and no power to make a difference. I, as the creator of this story, want the society to hear my voice and make audiences to care more about the vulnerable. I want to help these children with my efforts.   The film Silenced is an adaptation based on real events, the original version is based on the long-term sexual invasion and abuse of these deaf and mute children by principals and teachers in a school for the deaf and mute in Gwangju, South Korea, from 2000 to 2004. The film presents the tragedy of social reality, the powerless struggle of the righteous enthusiasts and the poor vulnerable groups fails, and no luck comes. This matter will be forgotten after the public opinion, only the cultural practitioners can record it, the artistic work itself is of the same category that expresses the things forgotten by themselves and others. In my short film, Gu Pan’s grandma is the only one who knows the sexual invasion experience of Gu Pan, Grandma's death means that the last person sharing the painful memory with her has left, her mental trauma has been revealed again, so she needs to seek the help of a psychological consultant. The biggest core of Gu Pan's story is her trauma, which she can't face and solve, this point may determine her actions, her words, and, of course, her destiny, and it may be the most fundamental thing to be dealt with by film, literature or art forms. What I always hope to obtain is the real narration and worries, which are what you are reluctant to mention in the mainstream media and mainstream discourse, it involves human dignity and real living conditions, I want to present the living essence of real female or other vulnerable groups,  it is important to tell its complexity, at the end of my short film, the psychological consultant asked if she would choose not to say it if she was given another chance? The choice of Gu Pan is, yes. She has known the end of the story, but she still chooses to suffer, this is the living   Time can change everything, for example, only when Gu Pan is an adult can she go out of the family independently, find herself, learn knowledge and start a new life, when she was young, she couldn't get rid of it. Of course, this is very cruel, she survived until adulthood because of that person, for Gu Pan, she will have the opportunity to be truly liberated, have a certain right to speak, and people will believe what she has said. If there is no time, she may still be in this state in the end.",

"Street Chess Community: Care, Conflict, and Competition",United States,Eugene,Yoo,"When I first came to Washington Square Park to play the chess hustlers, I wasn’t sure what to expect. I originally thought that people played street chess for the games, but I soon realized that street chess revolved around stories and community.  One hustler told me about how he grew up in Turkey as a dual hairdresser and chess expert, another that he was a rising rapper with a new album dropping soon, and another that he worked on Wall Street and came to play chess on the weekends simply for the joy of it. Before long, the wildly interesting stories were what kept me coming back to the street chess table.  I learned that the “chess hustlers” were not hustlers at all, but artists. Their profession might not be lucrative, but they chose to immerse themselves in a unique culture centered around a common passion. Interacting with this culture made me curious about how people build and give meaning to creative forms of sociality in urban settings like Washington Square Park. The street chess community transcends age and race; it is inclusive of everyone who loves chess and even those who don’t. I started journaling about my experiences interacting with street chess culture, which eventually turned into an ethnography and film project sharing the story of chess hustlers with others, breaking stereotypes about them and encouraging readers to more carefully consider this unique community. The experience certainly confirmed for me that you cannot properly study a group of people without interacting with them. ",

"Arriving, Returning, Staying. ",Germany,zoe,dimitriadis,"My first short film “Arriving, Returning, Staying.“ explores the complex feelings of belonging when migrating to Berlin. I interviewed three participants who have lived in Berlin for 10 years or more and asked them three questions: „“How do you feel when you go back to visit your home country?“, “How do you feel in Berlin?“ And finally, “What feels like home to you?“.   What particularly interests me is the relationship to the country of origin after having lived in another country for a longer period of time. What changes? Where does one feel foreign? Where does one feel at home? How do experiences in new environments affect one's relationship to home? What is home in the end and how closely is it linked to origin?",

3 Crayons,India,SNPS.shaji,NPushpangathan,"3 Crayons - A short film-  Synopsis  Off 3 colors and extended for 3 days, the 3 Crayons consists of 3 short films. The short film named RED crayon begins when the gate of a house is opened to a dull morning in winter. When the night gets darker and the gate closes, as the day ends, the first short RED Crayon ends.  The short film named Yellow Crayon also starts when the gate opens and ends when the gate closes. At last, the gate in the short film named Green Crayon remains open. As it points out, the short film never ends. Nobody closes the gate.   The Red, Yellow and Green Crayons indicate the three colors of traffic signal lights. Let's relate this to three situations that we commonly face in life.  The competition to win, the parents and society who are forcing the kids somehow to reach the first place always and understanding how losing and losing knowingly for others are stepping stones to even bigger successes.    Director Shaji N Pushpangathan tells the narrated by a child to him.   Shaji ingeniously uses and expands the philosophies And psychological theory developed by Dr. Eric Berne's TA (TRANSACTIONL ANALYSES) and the OK theory of Thomas A. Harris in the short film.  Nurturing our children for succeeding in life with humanitarian principles and help them to grow up as good children of the new generation is one of the messages the director visualizes.   An ideal family with the strong-minded parents, who helps the kids to face any difficult situations with optimistic approach is another key point Shaji wants to express through his film.  All the characters in the short film sow the seeds of positive thinking and the tagline at the end of the story is relevant.” IAM THE BEST, YOU ARE THE BEST ,WE ARE THE BEST AND LET’S HOPE FOR THE BEST ” ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdRE_w4E16U&ab_channel=Shajinpushpangathan

This film honors the valiant comrades who are the nation's unsung heroes.  Rigorous routine and advanced skill set is what shields these fighters to undercut the unstoppable, as the film documents their expertise, hard work and passion weighed under the eyes of innocent beings which appeases their emotions.

Prove You,India,O,Daapun,"DESCRIPTION:  There are some people who go to an unimaginable extent just to seek a little attention from the people around them. This is a story of a person who has the same kind of trait. The main character in this story is a bachelor who lives in a single rented place and is an indie musician. He always remains very insecure and thinks that people don't give him the attention he deserves. But, that is just in his head and it is not actually true, as he is always surrounded by his bandmates and his friends.  As he wanted to be the center of attention among his mates, he faked an injury where he acted as if his left leg was fractured and was wrapped around with bandages. He also used a pair of walking stick as he needed some kind of support to walk.  He thought that doing all of these will make his friends care about him more and always keep listening to him.  PLOT:  The video starts with him lying on his bed while he gets a message from one of his friends. He gets up, stretches his arms and reads the message. The message says that his friend will be there to pick him up within an hour or two. He replies to the message saying that he'll be ready. While he writes the message, he has a sarcastic smile on his face.  He gets out of his bed, turns on the radio and goes to the kitchen to prepare his breakfast. He then chooses the outfit that he'll be wearing. Then, the main part of his plan starts where he brings out the walking stick and the bandages as he has to fake his injury.  His friend arrives at his house, picks him up and takes him to the jam pad where his other bandmates were already present. The whole band starts jamming and enjoying the songs which they were playing. At one moment, when the band stops playing and were simply talking among themselves, he starts feeling insecure as they weren't giving him any special attention. This makes him lose control and he stands up in anger forgetting that he still had to fake his injury. His friends stare at him in shock knowing the actual truth.  He isn't able to decide what to do and lashes the walking stick and runs away from them.  He breaks down in shame and embarrassment and curses himself while realizing his mistake.  After a while, his mates come to his house to comfort him and let him know that he doesn't have to do any such kind of thing to gain their attention. They made him understand that they had always been there for him.  He apologizes to them again and they everyone enjoys and everything goes back to being normal again.",

The first story is about the beauty, movement and symbolic breathing of posidonia oceanica which is distracted and becomes a naked underwater surface. (Filmings after the cutting of posidonia in Ancient Kourion area in Limassol are used, shared by marine biologists in Cyprus).  Parallel to the story of posidonia oceanica the story of a woman unfolds. The woman, who symbolically breaths underwater embodies the movement of posidonia. When posidonia is ruined, she is also suffering, runs to escape until she is suffocated (from the distraction.)

With this title, we wanted to show that people are more than the labels that people or society put on them. Through the video clip, we want to demonstrate the importance of getting to know the people around us, listening to them, understanding their stories, motivations, difficulties, dreams, fears. All people have a history of struggles and challenges, but they also have a unique and innate beauty. For this reason, we want to go beyond showing the difficulties that each one faces: we also want to show the value that each human being has, showing that it is not our suffering that defines us, but our inner value, and showing that only dialogue and only by getting to know each other, we can better understand the people around us, and create empathy and understanding.

DESIGN BRUT,France,Maison,Mouton Noir,"Design Brut is a short documentary about an artistic experience exploring children's creativity in the sculptural design world.  The project Design Brut is inspired by French artist Jean Dubuffet’s notion of ‘Art Brut’, commonly translated as ‘raw art’, i.e. art created outside the academic tradition of fine art by children as well as marginal communities including prisoners and patients in psychiatric hospitals. According to Dubuffet, these groups produced works that were more direct, emotional, truthful and untrammelled by cultural conventions and norms, compared to those of trained artists, influenced and moulded by technical and academic knowledge. The philosophy behind ‘Art Brut’ inspired Galerie Philia’s founder Ygaël Attali to find ways to stimulate connections, reflections, and discourses on design beyond academic conventions through collective workshops and collaborations that would be sustainable.  The answer was Design Brut, an inaugural workshop that lasted 6 months introducing 6-7 years old children to the practice of sculptural design that took place in Breil-sur Roya, a French village nestled in the Roya valley in Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur. Under the supervision of their teacher Virgile Ganne and the artistic direction of contemporary designers Studio Behaghel Foiny, the children were invited to draw shapes and ideas on paper to form their own interpretations of sculptural design. The children’s drawings were then realised as physical designs, sculpted in local olive wood by a cabinetmaker from the region, followed by a small display in the chapel Notre-Dame-des-Monts in the presence of the children and local community.",https://vimeo.com/778493903

Kalasparsh,India,Deepak,Pendam,"Anxiety resides within every individual to some extent. While it may be a normal and temporary experience for some, others endure its severe and persistent effects, eventually impacting their mental and physical well-being. The purpose of creating this film is to depict the audience the detrimental consequences of anxiety and its profound influence on one's life. Each person possesses a unique trigger point to combat this state, as it varies for everyone. Personal encounters have motivated me to develop something that can effectively convey the internal and mental struggles I faced, as well as the challenges I encountered while trying to overcome and coexist with anxiety.  One particular incident compelled me to embark on this filmmaking journey. It was an incident that completely transformed my life. During my school days, I was unexpectedly called upon by a professor to deliver a speech on stage. I hadn't prepared for it, and unfortunately, I found myself unable to deliver the speech. The entire class and my friends burst into laughter that day. However, the true challenge emerged in the aftermath of that incident. People began to ignore me, and my friends started bullying me. Various unpleasant incidents unfolded, with some individuals even making derogatory remarks about my caste.  Subsequently, the repercussions of that event took a toll on my mental health. My confidence plummeted, and I found myself unable to articulate my ideas or thoughts in front of a group. This inability had a significant impact on my academic performance, and regrettably, its effects persist to this day. In my quest to conquer these internal anxiety issues, I embarked on a transformative journey through live painting performances. Engaging in these performances played a pivotal role in helping me overcome my anxiety state.",

Sushruta of Modern India - Pandit Madhusudan Gupta,India,Avigyan Kishor,Das,"This dramatic documentary is all about Pandit Madhusudan Gupta who performed undivided India’s first cadaveric dissection in the year 1836 under the guidance of Dr. Henry Goodeve and it was almost 3000 years after ‘Maharshi Sushruta’. It was also recognized as the Asia’s first human dissection. However, Pandit Gutpa faced social ostracism for his pioneering effort. This short film was an effort to discover untold story Pandit Gupta through a perception of an adolescent boy who once failed to answer a question about him. Life and struggle of Pandit Gupta were depicted through this film in very informative and lucid ways. Starting from his childhood to his untimely death – all important incidents and information are judiciously filmed. Thus, we came to know about his childhood, his brilliance in education and research, his professional excellence, his scientific thought and awareness against superstitions and religious blindness. Pandit Gupta was widely acknowledged as the “First Indian dissector of British India” and took the first phenomenal step in the direction of modern medical education. This significant incident was duly celebrated by the British in a militaristic fashion by firing a 26 round gun salute the Calcutta Fort William. Undoubtedly, Pandit Gupta’s single act of dissection has become a symbolic move of western medicine in undivided India.",

"I am still looking for you,...",Russian Federation,Pavel,Ruzyak,"A documentary film about a girl named Natasha from a Russian orphanage who looks for her roots now. Spending her whole life by adopted parents in the USA, she comes back to Russia for the first time at her late twenties. Natasha offers us a more general picture about people in society not knowing their origins, although they long for them every day, even if subconsciously.  Natasha, now around 28 years old, was born in Russia, in the city of Petrozavodsk. At the very early age, she was left by her mother and went into a Soviet orphanage. From there, she was adopted by American new parents and left for the USA with her sister (also in the same orphanage). She spent in the USA her whole life and only now decided for the first time to go beck alone to her home town. We shot this comeback. We discover with Natasha her orphanage, her old friends, her caretakers. Above all, we follow her comeback to her roots through her native language language. Natasha has forgotten her mother language and now in Russia she was actively learning Russian again. It was more then just learning a language for her. Souvenirs came back with Russian words. Natasha tells us about her mother who is in a mental asylum up to these days and how she has visited her. She tells us about her new life in the USA and her feeling about her past.  A visual style is applied to the story, very strict and minimalistic, showing the inner feelings of Natasha (not yet fully developed in such a short form). We have interviews with her dearest friend and her caretaker from the orphanage along worth some additional material. What the film misses to make it into a feature film (that the topic definitely deserves) is her life in the USA, her parents, her sister in the USA (with whom she will come back to Russia next year). Also we would like to introduce her mother separately and to discover more the system of orphanage and mental institution system that is problematic up to nowadays in Russia. It would complete a fragile portrait of Natasha who, although not admitting it, has a lot of painful and deep wounds on her soul.",

The androgynous creature, whose one half was female and the other half was male, was thought to have originated from the Moon.Their strength and courage was terrible, and their thinking was daring. They stormed the sky and even lifted their hands against the gods. Zeus became angry and split them in two. From that point on, each one yearned for the other half. The couples who found each other had not yet received the mercy of becoming one from the gods. Longing to express their love, they could only do so by embracing each other.Since human nature has been split in two, we are all searching for our missing other half. Someone we are not only driven to by our desires, but also someone who was created for us in our emotions.Eros instills hope in us for the future and guides us to ourselves.Therefore each of us is a half of a whole person, split in two like the half-finned fish.

Mahsa Amini died on September 16, 2022. She was only 22 years old. She was in the custody of the Iranian Moral Police after being arrested for improper use of the hijab (veil) that showed some locks of hair. On August 15, the ultra-conservative Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi signed a decree that tightens the obligation of using the hijab, but the law on dress codes has been in force since the 1979 Revolution. Today in Iran for women it is strictly forbidden to show hair, neck and shoulders and for those who do not respect this decree, the use of technology for facial recognition is envisaged. Women are prevented from swimming in the sea and the lake, dancing or singing if not accompanied in the duet by a man, having equal access to the job positions of male citizens and traveling abroad unless accompanied by their husbands. Since Mahsa Amini's death, protests against the regime have erupted throughout the country and nowadays there are at least 500 victims and thousands of arbitrary arrests. We do not know the exact numbers because the Iranian government has ordered the blocking of internet to stem the spread of information. «Be our voice» is the request for help from Iranian women and we guys of the troupe - as aspiring filmmakers - wanted to try to give it resonance through the language that best represents us: ""The unveiled woman"" is a short film for Mahsa Amini (22 years old) and for all the Iranian women and men who have paid with their lives for their freedom of choice .",

Saving Littlejohn,United Kingdom,Mhairi,Fenton,"With the 6th mass extinction looming, focusing on saving one species might seem futile. With media attention often focusing on the larger endangered mammals; a mundane nocturnal tree frog, hidden in the Australian bush, could go extinct without anyone knowing. Researchers at The University of Newcastle believe that saving one can save many. This one is the Littlejohn tree frog.  The Littlejohn tree frog is currently listed as vulnerable under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The conservation status is currently under consideration to be increased to endangered following rapid drops in numbers. This small frog is being devasted with forest fires, chytrid fungus and genetic isolation. At the current rate, this species will be extinct within a decade. But how do researchers stop this species from becoming endangered or left to go extinct? They must research into their past, their present and the possible futures to save this species.  In this documentary, we see the hidden lives of The Littlejohn's Tree Frogs and the three scientists determined to save them. Dr Michael Mahony accounts their Past, Dr Alex Callen is saving the Present and Dr Rose Upton is securing their Future.   No species should go extinct before ever being known. ",

Since 2018, Yiwu Jiangbei Xiazhu Village has kept up with the trend of the times. The development of e-commerce live broadcasting industry has been in full swing. People with dreams of wealth have come here in droves, once crowding the streets of Beixia Zhu. However, the journey of pursuing dreams was not smooth. Some entrepreneurs came here with enthusiasm. After the harvest of training institutions, the washing of high rent, and the futility of live broadcast, they returned empty handed, leaving only a word of disappointment that was ""exaggerated"" here.            The reason for these people's failure is not only their lack of deep thinking, but also the lack of systematic management in the environment of going north to Zhu. The online celebrity ecosystem and e-commerce operation here are not mature enough. Merchants and anchors are not close to each other. One is responsible for shipping and the other is responsible for carrying goods, which is almost irrelevant. This creates an interesting phenomenon. When you go north to Zhu, people and things are close, but people and people are estranged.            By focusing on the experience of entrepreneurs in Jiangbei, we can truly record the industrial context there and explore the survival status of entrepreneurs there.",

"""Murphy"" Wojciech Kamerys",Poland,Wojtek,Kamerys,"“I cannot remember the last few days. Everything is blurred, indistinguishable. I remember my mother’s voice on the phone, a voice full of pain, some hundreds of kilometres away from me. Something has changed since then. Something in my head. Something like a filter, a barrier, a cloak that protects the shell from damage at the cost of internal destruction. I’ve been struggling with that ever since. (...) My grandfather died two years ago, two weeks after my wedding. I still visit him once a week, exchange a handshake with the marble tombstone, sit on the bench and talk. I remember the first time, the initial uncertainty and a certain dose of awkwardness changing into a familiar feeling of safety and trust. Sometimes I came here to gather my thoughts, sometimes just to smoke a cigarette, and sometimes to fall into silence. Just behind the gravestone, there is a tree. Its rustle became the silence’s filler, an indistinguishable answer. Soothing and calming. Since then, I have changed my habits, my approach. I stopped demanding, expecting anything. This has helped. But sometimes I still disappear, run away with my thoughts, trying to bury, hide what is uncomfortable. To hide from strangers, from loved ones.”    ""Murphy"" is a short film, a kind of diary documenting the process of getting used to the unknown. It is a portal to events from the past, rooted in the present; shows the connections and dependencies between what was and what is to come; digs up elements of memory hidden for various reasons, often due to emotional burden. Finally, it fights against the inevitability of events, opposes the destructive element of time.",

The situation is already scary, but the spread of corona virus has made it scarier. Only a naturally balanced climate can rescue us from the trouble we are in, any further imbalance will make it irreparably dangerous. Better climate means better health and better health signifies better life.  Earth has lost 28 trillion tones of ice in less than 30 years. Developed country is not a place where the poor have cars. It is where the rich use public transportation as 60 people are adjusted in a bus as compared to 5 in a car. Air pollution is the world’s top killer, according to new research. Methane is the second biggest contributor to human-caused global warming after CO2. Livestock contributes significantly in environmental degradation. Kashmir fortunately had a vast green area, but we have destroyed a major part of it. Our valley was green, but we have destroyed that greenery and we have to restore that charm if we are to survive and our generations are to survive.

Breathe,Russian Federation,Gulnaz,Galimullina,"Breathing and blinking - are the only thing that ALS patients can do in the last stage of the disease. The whole body is paralyzed and the mind remains fettered in its own body. This is an unexplored disease. It is not inherited and cannot be predicted or prevented. Patients with this diagnosis are given 3-4 years of life, but there are those who live for 20 years or more. The most famous person in the world who lived a long life with ALS is Stephen Hawking.  Tanya has been living with ALS for over 20 years. She can hardly speak, sometimes her text is voiced by a neuro-voice. To do this, you need to type a speech using an eye tracker and an invisible announcer will voice the text. The laptop is her main assistant connecting with the outside world. Despite everything, Tanya leads an active social life: she organizes various events and helps people with ALS. She is a prime example and a powerful motivator. Her husband and family support her in everything. “Living with a person with ALS is like living two lives: for yourself and for your beloved Tatusik,” – her husband Pavel says so warmly about his wife.  There are two families in the film. The Valkov family is just starting to live with ALS. Lena does not accept her diagnosis and tries to live as usual. But the disease is developing. She has to take on new changes each time.  Two parallel histories help to trace the development of the disease from both sides: a physical and a psychological points of view. The film ""Breathe"" is primarily about love, about love in the family, about love for life, about mutual support. The film helps not to shy people with ALS,  as they often withdraw from society. The film shows the value and importance of life in every moment. ",

The aim is for the community of gender minorities to learn that they don’t need to change themselves, that we must change society’s ideals of beauty and self-worth.  I created a 6 and a 1/2 minute introductory documentary-style video for YouTube that will introduce the topic, define key terms, and provide interview clips from a variety of women and gender minorities. https://youtu.be/UFmcVQN7RE4  In addition, I created six TikTok videos that will highlight specific body features. https://www.tiktok.com/@theunlearninghandbook. Full reel: https://drive.google.com/file/d/125lRLDC4Inthl-tbYE5HVLmA7LzcDu3g/view?usp=sharing  I applied for and received the Jill Gabbe Leader Fund in the amount of 1,000 USD to fund this project.

The skatepark and its activities will be integrated into the daily programming for the children of the centre and will soon open to the wider community of the surrounding areas.

Volunteers worked hard through the days and nights of the build to make it the space that exists there today. The film focuses on the process of the construction whilst also mentioning the future of skatepark construction in Morocco. It concludes with a nod towards the bright time ahead for all of the children at the brand new Fiers et Forts Skatepark. The film was made voluntarily by Jago Stock, a 20 year old English filmmaker.

She talked to us & the people around her & we started a fundraising campaign for her and in a few hours the money was raised!  Everyone was so happy. Gechi was finally going to walk!  A few weeks later she sent us some pictures that moved everyone to tears.  For the first time ever, she was standing on her two feet. Yes TWO FEET!  This young woman has been through alot.

 Partial Truth,India,Saboteur,Art,"Angshik Satyi - A film by supratim Roy is basically showcasing the age old practice of society where women are the common prey of oppression. The film is a comparative story of two families of different economical background. Where the daughter of the poorer family is the major earning source inspite of that the position of both the women in their family is somewhere the same. They are facing the domination of being a women . They are being questioned whenever they are choosing growth in their life, they are trying to eliminate the social burden from their life or they are trying to get rid off  the violence by all means. All they are asked for is to adjust with domination of this hegemonic society. When Joya is accepting her promotion though she knows the situation of her family, or after knowing that siddartha has lost his job, she is not that much disturbed rather she wishes to smoke weed with her brother that day as a rakhi gift. This responses are reflecting the urge to escape from our usual shape of thought where women will always sacrifice her living. Parallely in the other family despite of the fact that  Joya is being tortured physically and mentally ,when she is telling her brother of her wish to be independent, he is questing her decision. He can see the scars of violence on her sister's body but he is silent rather praising his brother in law as he need a job with his help. All these circumstances are very common in our male chauvinist society. These oppressions, expectation of adjustment ,frame of sacrifice somewhere engenders anger and resistance and propel them towards independent  living. Individualism must be the aspect of living.  Someday our linear society will completely adapt the fact by all means for ""somewhere at some new moon we will learn that sleeping is not death"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_54_oaIqwIY&t=2s

"IN- JUSTICE ""The 2012 Nirbhaya Gang Rape Case""",India,Yash,Johari,"This is a documentary based on a real event that happened in Delhi in 2012.  The 2012 Delhi gang rape and murder case involved a rape and fatal assault that occurred on 16 December 2012 in Munirka, a neighborhood in South West Delhi. The incident took place when Nirbhaya (a name used to protect the identities of rape victims), a 22-year-old physiotherapy intern, was beaten, gang-raped, and tortured in a private bus in which she was traveling with her male friend. There were six others in the bus, including the driver, all of whom raped the woman and beat her friend. Eleven days after the assault, she was transferred to a hospital in Singapore for emergency treatment but died two days later. The incident generated widespread national and international coverage and was widely condemned, both in India and abroad. Subsequently, public protests against the state and central governments for failing to provide adequate security for women took place in New Delhi, where thousands of protesters clashed with security forces. Since Indian law does not allow the press to publish a rape victim's name, the victim was widely known as Nirbhaya, meaning ""fearless"", and her struggle and death became a symbol of women's resistance to rape around the world.   All the accused were arrested and charged with sexual assault and murder. One of the accused, Ram Singh, died in police custody from possible suicide on 11 March 2013. According to some published reports, the police say Ram Singh hanged himself, but defense lawyers and his family allege he was murdered. The rest of the accused went on trial in a fast-track court; the prosecution finished presenting its evidence on 8 July 2013. The juvenile accused was convicted of rape and murder and given the maximum sentence of three years imprisonment in a reform facility, as per the Juvenile Justice Act. On 10 September 2013, the four remaining adult defendants – Pawan Gupta, Vinay Sharma, Akshay Thakur, and Mukesh Singh (Ram Singh's brother) – were found guilty of rape and murder and three days later were sentenced to death. In the death reference case and hearing appeals on 13 March 2014, Delhi High Court upheld the guilty verdict and the death sentences On 18 December 2019, the Supreme Court of India rejected the final appeals of the condemned perpetrators of the attack.   On 20 March 2020, at 5:30 a.m. IST, The four adult convicts Mukesh Singh, Vinay Sharma, Akshay Thakur, and Pawan Gupta were executed at Tihar Jail. They were hanged on gallows specially designed for four people. According to prison officials, the four convicts refused the offers of the last meal and new clothes prior to the execution. They were blindfolded and did not resist as they were led to the gallows; however, Vinay Sharma suffered a breakdown prior to his execution and began pleading with the guards. The four convicts were pronounced dead after hanging for 30 minutes.  ",

There are two basic types of bipolar disorder, among them, and type II is defined as a pattern of depressive episodes and mild manic episodes. In its pathological manifestations, it is very similar to the presenting features of depression. This leads to frequent misdiagnosis and incorrect medication in the diagnosis process, and this treatment process causes different degrees of physical and psychological damage to the patient. Against the above background, this work was created to express the inner world of the main character who suffers from ""bipolar disorder. Through this work, we hope to make more people understand and recognize the mental illness of ""bipolar disorder"", and to convey the inner world of people who suffering from this mental illness to the audience, so that they can think about how to get along with them.",

Mustafa - true story of a Tiger,India,anushree,shukla,"My documentary is about Mustafa, a man-eating Tiger in the jungles of Pilibhit, Uttar Pradesh, India who had been ordered to be killed on-sight. Habitat loss and increase in population density have forced animals like Mustafa to come out of the jungle and become a man-eater. These tigers are framed for the crime they have never committed. The documentary showcases a detailed description about what goes on in a rescue operation in the forests of India and how the forest department deals with the hurdles while saving the animal as well as protecting the humans residing locally in or near the areas. The documentary shows how Mustafa was rescued by Dr Utkarsh Shukla and his team along with all the constraints faced by them. Dr Utkarsh Shukla has been working as a Deputy Director of Lucknow Zoo, Uttar Pradesh, India. He has been rescuing over 150 animals in distress for a span of 25 years now involving several Leopards, Tigers, two Dolphins, a Rhino and many others.  My documentary was shot in India for which I had to travel back to the jungles of Pilibhit where the incident took place. This project is close to my heart as Dr. Utkarsh Shukla is my father and the man behind saving the lives of so many wild animals. The shoot took place in summer of 2022 in Pilibhit, Dudhwa National park and Lucknow zoo in Uttar Pradesh, India.  The documentary was shot on a Nikon D850, as it was difficult to take any crew in the interiors of the forest, let alone travel back to India with me. The shoot lasted 15 days which was later edited with the help of my classmate Viraj Dhorajiya who is the main editor of the documentary. The music was done by Solmi Kim and mix and master was performed by Prajuwal Prakash. My head of department Lee-jane has been a great support to me, helping me develop the story. My cinematography faculty Peter Bathurst helped me before the shoot, making me understand how to plan my visuals beforehand which made the editing easier.    I would like to thank the forest department of Uttar Pradesh, Dudhwa National Park and Pilibhit tiger reserve, including all the officials that were a part of the operation to rescue Mustafa, to take out time and give their precious insights and intricate details for this Documentary. The people involved in this operation are as follows:  Dr. Utkarsh Shukla Deputy Director  Lucknow Zoo, Uttar Pradesh, India  P.P. Singh Chief conservator Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, India  Dr.Mudit Gupta Sr.Coordinator Tarai Arc  WWF-India  Dabeer Hasan Sr. Project Officer WWF-India  Naresh Kumar Sr.Project Officer WWF-India.

I Feel Perfect,France,Tomer,Almagor,"Despite experiencing significant hardships and homelessness in a foreign country, Stoian still considers himself to be content with what he has. He tells the story about his arrival to Paris, his philosophy on life, and accepting the possibility of his circumstances never changing until his soul is collected into the afterlife. Every story on homelessness is unique–they are often dismissed into the shadows of our society. This short documentary is the quintessence of unveiling this reality.  DIRECTORS’ STATEMENT “The common misconception of life in Paris circulates around ideas of cafés, baguettes and sipping wine, but there are far deeper realities behind these curtains. Once these curtains are raised, intrinsic and unheard stories are unveiled. We met Stoian by an overpass along a highway in the 16th arrondissement. The 64-year-old Bulgarian was very eager to converse with the help of a translating app. Despite not speaking the same language, our emotional connection offered us a special human-to-human experience. His willingness to share his story allowed us to overcome what initially seemed impossible: establishing an ineffable listener-to-storyteller bond in defiance of our linguistic handicap. Having attended a thought-provoking class as Masters students, our project scaled up to a greater magnitude. We realised that our initiative had a bigger purpose than simply an in-class project, as it shed light on how converging consciences from disparate poles interact.”",

SWITCH,India,Gunjan,Kashyap,"Switch is a project thats not merely a depiction of change in state and one's situation, rather it is an attempt at replicating the essence of time itself and how man is nothing but an element that is used to reach already fated results. It dwells upon the concept of the everchanging state of human nature in relation to their physical state in the most simplest of depiction. The movie aims at a full circle from the begining to the near end of one's life and in order to do so, the entire movie has been attempted in one shot. Without cuts, breaks or interludes so as to represent, in a way, the flow if time itself that cannot be stopped via any means. It explores the reality of a man through his responsibilities. His son, who is a liability at the beginning, a sort of responsibility that he must take care of, in due time becomes his biggest asset and he, himself turns into a liability. It shows the full circle that life takes and the lessons it attempt at teaching us through the means of time. The concept isnt grand in any manner however the scope of comparison and the lessons learnt are left entirely upon the imagination of the viewer and hence, even though the depiction is not grand the abstract nature of experience gained is beyound the scope of being called 'grand'.",

Time,Greece,Domenica,Varvalouka,"A theme with countless ways to convey and a variety of thoughts and perspectives to move around. The sea loved and hated, a source of peace and fear. An eternal constant, that's alive in its own rhythm, with movement, with breath and atmosphere. It is a huge source of mystery as many parts of it have not been explored, creating an extremely fertile ground for the imagination, to give birth to thoughts and conjectures about what it can hide. Myths and stories from around the world come to light every now and then and create a huge interest and source of inspiration for the artistic field. Fantastic water creatures have been my subject several times, without always understanding how I came to this choice. In the case of this video, in fact, I filmed points that I couldn't even approach, but they seemed very interesting and completely obvious signs of time. The waves, sometimes calm, sometimes dynamic, sometimes ""angry"", that whip the whole place, seem to look like corresponding breaths, calm, intense and sometimes uncontrollable. This gives the impression that the whole place ""breathes"", combines abandonment and loss with life. Buildings and ships creak at every movement of the air or any other kind of interference, as if breathing. One has the impression that it is located in a highly navigable place, not on a piece of land, everything communicates. The charming aquatic and above-ground creatures give the space another note and life. Creatures so united with the environment that they give the feeling of camouflage. Their presence is felt only in case something disturbs the atmosphere. They move slowly and calmly, making their presence difficult to feel. Unfortunately I couldn't capture the natural sounds, so I tried to find them in individual recordings and compose them in a way that conveys the atmosphere. The general impression is of a floating cemetery, of a timeless reality, with a strong atmosphere of an eerie kind of life. Place of chronologies, coexistences and opposites. The senses of time are confused, life meets death, the eternal meets the finished.",

Under Skin,China,ting,zhou,"   This microfilm is adapted from true stories which would commonly happen in some families in China. They are more like old pictures or scenes of real life coming to my mind one after another. Thus I am using an aspect ratio of 4:3, to better guide the audiences to relate to similar scenes in their own life.  Also, I add some creative ideas to this film. For example, the change from full color to black-white and back to full color is a reflection of different moods and feelings of the aunt, with an emphasis on her transformation moment. Another point is the background sound or music excerpted from Chinese traditional Yu Opera Hua Mulan featuring the legendary life of a female hero in ancient China. I am using one of its classic lines “who says that women are inferior to men”to reveal the film’s underlying criticism on the “valuing males over females”reality or gender discrimination.",
Tic Tac,Bulgaria,Yaroslav,Stavrev,"Ever since the ancient times people feel the need to measure the time. In the beginning they used sundials, then water clocks, then hourglasses. In the 17th century, the Dutch astronomer, physicist and mathematician Christian Huygens invented a mechanical pendulum clock. Later, the pendulum was replaced by a mainspring, which allowed the size of the clocks to be reduced. Throughout all those times, for the watches to be working and for the people to precisely know what time it is, the watchmakers had to step in and do their job. As a result of progress,  nowadays, they are faced with a new problem, which could deprive them from the opportunity to continue with their craft.   With the advent of quartz, electronic, and now smart watches, the craft of watchmaking is about to disappear, leaving a large portion of watchmakers out of business.  Gencho Yanovski started working as a watchmaker in 1962. But due to the advent of modern clocks and his age, he retired in 2010. Now he fulfils his time with writing, but he continues to carry watchmaking in his heart and despite his advanced age he does not give up. For over 20 years he has maintained the town clock of Kyustendil Municipality. An old, worn out and neglected mechanism. The almost 600-year-old clock bell on every hour, reminds the people of Kyustendil and its guests that the another 60 mins from their lives have passed.   Gencho Yanovski takes no money for the maintenance and repairs of the town clock. His work is a gift for the residents of Kyustendil. The craftsmen who make specific details for repairs to the mechanism are also people who love the city and often work without asking for payment for their work.  The passion with which the retired clockmaker cares for and makes innovations and improvements to the old mechanism is impressive and inspiring, but age is having a hard time taking care of the town's clocks, and no other clockmaker is hired to maintain them.  Time is irretrievably passing away. It's like a ship without a berth. It is constantly on the move.",

What does it mean to grow up in Italy, today, as an afro-descendant child of immigrants? From North to South, Crossing the color line tells their stories, experiences, and points of view. The documentary was thought as a 'safe space' where Italian afro-descendants could freely express themselves and rebuild together a first-person narrative: a new Italian youth, with a rich identity, complex and sometimes hesitant, talks about roots, self-acceptance, nationality and dual belonging. Beyond the color line, those testimonies challenge the existing idea of 'italianity' and ask to rethink the sense of belonging to a national identity, redefining the traditional geographical and political boundaries, as contemporary Italy now has another face, which also looks like them.",

HOME2,India,Ria,Nalavade,"One afternoon in a good-looking posh Mumbai house, 7 year old Inaya suddenly can’t recognise her parents or her own home. She struggles like a captive in the arms of her mother. Her parents call the therapist to uncover what is going on with their child. Turns out that, Inaya is a lonely, anxious child, neglected by her ever-quarrelling parents. Her only friend is her pet goldfish, who lives in a state like herself - in crystal clear water but trapped. Ever since her absentee father gifted her the new mood monitoring HappyGlasses device, Inaya has been hooked on to it. The HappyGlasses are super smart goggles that scan her surroundings, record her emotions to it, and with AI, build a virtual-world based on that information. This virtual-world automatically starts playing around her to calm her down, whenever her anxiety peaks. After seeing the footage on the device, the therapist reveals that when Inaya’s parents had left her home alone, the caretaker - Uma had no choice but to take Inaya to her own house, a loving place, where she played with Uma's daughter Mugdha. This was Inaya’s happiest memory yet. The Happy Glasses created a simulation of Uma’s ‘home’, and inevitably played it to her whenever she was around her toxic parents, so-much-so that she began to believe it, erasing all other ‘home’ related memories - including her own family. Her parents continue to blame each other, and in the process, the device breaks - driving a mentally imbalanced Inaya to dangerously and frantically chase her virtual idea of ‘home’. HOME2 explores what home feels like, what it looks like and tries to explore what keeps children glued to their home screens rather than home itself.",https://vimeo.com/779516735

Tic Tac,Bulgaria,Yaroslav,Stavrev,"Ever since the ancient times people feel the need to measure the time. In the beginning they used sundials, then water clocks, then hourglasses. In the 17th century, the Dutch astronomer, physicist and mathematician Christian Huygens invented a mechanical pendulum clock. Later, the pendulum was replaced by a mainspring, which allowed the size of the clocks to be reduced. Throughout all those times, for the watches to be working and for the people to precisely know what time it is, the watchmakers had to step in and do their job. As a result of progress,  nowadays, they are faced with a new problem, which could deprive them from the opportunity to continue with their craft.   With the advent of quartz, electronic, and now smart watches, the craft of watchmaking is about to disappear, leaving a large portion of watchmakers out of business.  Gencho Yanovski started working as a watchmaker in 1962. But due to the advent of modern clocks and his age, he retired in 2010. Now he fulfils his time with writing, but he continues to carry watchmaking in his heart and despite his advanced age he does not give up. For over 20 years he has maintained the town clock of Kyustendil Municipality. An old, worn out and neglected mechanism. The almost 600-year-old clock bell on every hour, reminds the people of Kyustendil and its guests that the another 60 mins from their lives have passed.   Gencho Yanovski takes no money for the maintenance and repairs of the town clock. His work is a gift for the residents of Kyustendil. The craftsmen who make specific details for repairs to the mechanism are also people who love the city and often work without asking for payment for their work.  The passion with which the retired clockmaker cares for and makes innovations and improvements to the old mechanism is impressive and inspiring, but age is having a hard time taking care of the town's clocks, and no other clockmaker is hired to maintain them.  Time is irretrievably passing away. It's like a ship without a berth. It is constantly on the move.",

Moses Gate: Return of The Wild,India,Chinmay,Puranik,"Moses Gate Country Park, back in the 19th century was famously known as a site for the paper making industry.

The Croal River that passes by became polluted and the water lodges that were made could not support the mill. The quality of water and the surrounded habitat was so contaminated that it couldn’t host any wildlife around. Soon after its shutdown it was opened as a country park and as the quality of water and habitat improved in the years, wildlife returned. Spring is just about to start and so are the mating rituals of several waterfowls, which take place in the water lodges. Coots start building their nests above the water surface and the water lodge also helps several other birds in their daily lives. The river is an important habitat as well and there’s one little species that makes the most out of it. The American Mink feeds itself from this river and is a daily visitor. The Woodland beside the river not only benefits the small birds and squirrels but the Roe Deer as well. By and large, the recovery of these habitats has helped the diverse wildlife thrive in its natural way.",

Suddenly, his eyes fall on a poster that reads “Beware of dacoits”. He becomes a little worried after reading it. So, he gives the money to the shopkeeper and leaves quickly from there, holding the wad of notes. While walking, he is thinking that it would be safer to sneak through the forest.  He leaves the road and starts walking through the forest expeditiously. On his way home he gets suspicious and feels that someone is following him. He tries to see with the eye directed to one side. Indeed! Someone is following him and coming towards him at the same speed as his. He starts trembling. “Isn’t he the dacoit? He will kill me and loot away my money!” He starts running and so as the follower.  He ran into a tall crop field and the man who is following him also enters the field. He is now sure that the man is a dacoit. The village alleys are now a little ahead of the field.  He leaves the field as rapidly as possible and starts running wildly in the deserted lanes of the village. “Oh, God! What an evil man he is. He is coming after me.”  Haru Babu is panting and his clothes are drenched in sweat. He gets dizzy and is about to fall when he finds some people sitting on the side of an intersection point. He gathers courage after seeing them. He turns around and starts thrashing the man badly.  But that man turns out to be an innocent-looking boy, wrapped in a shawl. The poor fellow panics and tells Haru Babu that, that the betel nut shopkeeper had asked him to follow him so that he could reach his friend’s house because his friend lives near Haru's house. And do you always walk in this haphazard manner?  Haru Babu dumbfoundedly kept staring at him. He couldn’t say anything. It starts raining. He opens an umbrella and with a slight jerk Haru Babu gestures for the boy to come under it and they start walking together.",

Vow,Croatia,Hyper,Borea,"Due to the war in former Yugoslavia, landscape documentary film flourished in the last few decades. These are films that are simple in their visual form, restrained from camera movements and precise in editing. Within those specific films, it is not unusual to have the onslaught of the outside world provoked within the film in a very utopian way,  precisely because there is always something missing in them, whether in picture, sound or people who are no more alive. The action in these films always takes place ""elsewhere"", outside the frames themselves, thus there is a point on the viewers who create ""what is missing"" with their own imagination. In their films, Straub and Huillet separated sound from image in the first and last frames, which would bring viewers from the world of film back to the real world. Summarizing their strategy would give them a rediscovery of fundamental visual pleasure by concentrating on the film’s basic elements such as sound, light, and movement that are contrasted with landscapes and poetry.  One of the main reasons why wars still happen even today are narrative and stories that are transmitted from generation to generation.  These stories have been passed on from one's families to one's country, especially in the Balkans where all the nations reckon that they are being denied some of the territories that their neighbors are holding. That is why we are now having an ongoing war in Ukraine.  Our protagonist claims that "" as long as there are graveyards and Churches"" in 'other' territories there will always be reasons for a war between nations.   The only problem is that your own graveyards and churches are abandoned and unmaintained.",

Henri, a film archivist living in the reversed 1930s stumbles upon an old film roll, that depicts time flowing in the normal direction. He invites two American curators – Iris and John – to his Parisian home cinema in an attempt to convince them to spread his movie, and thus maybe halter the moonwalk of time. The film he has found namely bears ominous signs of an upcoming new world war…   Palindrome is a filmic experiment with surround sound, that stands on the border between cinema, theater and installation. An essential part of the plot is conveyed through the sound - Henri, Iris and John never appear on the screen, one only hears their voices. The surround sound is especially used to give the viewers the feeling that the characters sit among them in the audience - dialogues and sounds not only come from the front, but from all four walls of the cinema hall. In one scene one hears the humming of an old projector from the rear wall, the whispers of the guests coming from the room centre, and a curious monologizing voice coming from the front. Utilizing the surround sound in an experimental way, Palindrome tries to create and encourage a new way to experience cinema - a new spatial cinema, where the fiction is not only limited to the screen, but now also encompasses the whole cinema hall.",https://vimeo.com/281065696

This societal conditioning has come at the expense of dulling the senses of humans.

A young woman named Nova (Bailey Hubbs) seeks treatment as she begins to feel her conditioning unravel. Her symptoms reveal glimpses into the spectrum of the human experience that she has never felt before, leaving her terrified and confused but also curious and liberated. Enticed by these glimpses of her inner humanity, Nova is faced with a dangerous dilemma: receive treatment and return to her baseline, conditioned state, or venture alone into the unknown depths of the human psyche.

The Union Carbide Factory dumped all their chemical wastes in pits and ponds around the area of the factory and recent research shows about 3.5km radially the land’s groundwater index is affected ie; not fit for drinking. The colonies comprising hundreds of families are still residing in that area.  Why about a slum in Bhopal?

American Beauty,United States,Mansoor,Khalid,"The documentary ""American Beauty is a thought-provoking exploration of how American people perceive beauty. I traveled to different malls in Atlanta, GA interviewing individuals from various backgrounds, ages, and ethnicities, asking them to share their thoughts and experiences on what beauty means to them. The documentary takes a broad approach, covering a range of beauty-related topics. People are asked about their views on physical appearance, fashion, makeup, body image, aging, and cultural diversity. They discuss their experiences with beauty standards and how media, advertising, and social media have influenced them. Throughout the film, people share candid and surprising opinions on what they find beautiful and why. Some argue that beauty is subjective and personal, while others believe that there are objective standards that must be met. Some talk about how they have struggled with societal expectations of beauty, while others celebrate their unique features and differences. There is a comparison of the difference in point of view of a TV program in Pakistan where a young girl is ridiculed and policed by a bunch of ladies who share what should be a perfect look for her. The documentary also explores the darker side of beauty, with some individuals sharing stories of discrimination and prejudice based on their appearance or cultural background. Others discuss the impact of beauty standards on mental health, including body dysmorphia. Overall, ""American Beauty is a fascinating documentary that challenges viewers to think critically about their perceptions of beauty. It provides a nuanced and diverse perspective on this complex and often controversial topic. It offers insights into how beauty intersects with culture, identity, and personal experience in America versus the Pakistani community.",

It is about a couple who is head over heels in love, a couple whose love is extraordinary yet relatable. The wife is told by everyone around her that she is too trusting of her husband. Since her own mother was too possessive of her father and made their life a living hell, the wife decided never to follow her mother’s lead or footsteps. In fact, she makes a pact with her to be husband that if she ever acts like an ordinary wife, he can change her name. The universe puts her trust in a test! On their wedding anniversary (which she thought the husband had forgotten about), the husband tells her that he wanted to meet a female friend of his (apparently an ex). She agrees while remembering her pact. Soon enough, she starts doubting her own instincts and delves herself into the contemplation of “what ifs”, she starts writing sad poetry. Maybe her mother and everyone else around was right. Maybe, she should never trust her husband. Maybe, he would cheat on her. She starts remembering all the times she trusted her husband. The seed of doubt planted by the society in her mind overpowers her love for her husband and she starts panicking. When the husband reaches home he finds her crying in the room and pulls out flowers because he didn’t forget the anniversary nor did he go to meet any other woman. He just wanted to make her accept her true feelings as a wife and not focus on not becoming a typical housewife. He makes her admit the fact that although she does not want anyone to come between them, jealousy and possessiveness in moderation could be a healthy part of an intimate relationship. He explains this all to her, she understands, they both smile and he silently whispers if he should “Change her Name” 😊 As they live happily like before and after, rather forever.  Let there be spaces in your togetherness, And let the winds of the heavens dance between you. Love one another but make not a bond of love: Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls. Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup. Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf. Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone, Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music. Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping. For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts. And stand together, yet not too near together: For the pillars of the temple stand apart, And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow.” ― Khalil Gibran, The Prophet ",

The goal was to thematize the different types of inner struggle in an abstract and aesthetic way.  Our three protagonists embark on a journey to themselves. The three worlds are connected by a continuing narrative structure that builds on each other and is carried by the music and the sound design as artistic elements. Tension, overload, letting go and coming home are the keywords that determine the pacing of our social spot Doubts.  Everyone is invited to draw more strength from themselves and reflect on it. Realize that you are not alone with these doubting thoughts. Each of us struggles with ourselves. Even success does not allow us to defeat the doubts. They are barely noticeable from the outside, even if they are screaming inside. But it is up to us how much attention we pay to these voices in our head. To question the external and internal expectations and allow overload and chaos to move aside for calm and clarity.  The quote at the end finishes the film with a critique of our society which profits from our self doubts and encourages us to set out on the path to more self-acceptance.  ",

RECYLCLING) is a process in which starting materials are transformed into secondary raw materials and from these a new product is created, the recyclate.

The first square shows images created by editing and arranging the film footage. The image reproduces and shows. The second square is an erroneous reproduction of the data of the first. Here the image becomes a machine-readable file and thus loses its image object. The third square shows a sequence created by an AI that interprets the second square. The image object returns. First as a forest.  The sound was created in the same way and picks up on the tripartition of the image through the stereo arrangement. Cars can be heard, which become a cloud of noise, as well as destroyed audio data. On the right ear, a techno song can be heard, which, however, has errors and irregularities due to its creation by an artificial intelligence.

Der Ton entstand auf die gleiche Art und Weise und greift durch die Stereo-Anordnung die Dreiteilung des Bildes auf.

Auf dem rechten Ohr ist wiederum ein Technosong zu hören, welcher aufgrund der Entstehung durch eine künstliche Intelligenz jedoch Fehler und Unebenheiten aufweist.",

Noise,Italy,Vito,Sugameli,"The protagonist, does not have a name, is a figure in which each student can identify himself: overwhelmed by his expectations, often disregarded and those of family members. She lives in a continuous state of anxiety for the evaluation condition to which she is subjected every day. She escapes every form of outburst and lives the school routine by repressing her suffering, until the concern for the meeting between her mother and the teacher and the bubble of judgment, in which she finds herself locked up, leads her to react.  Noise is much more than a simple short film. It comes from our expectations, from the emotions that accompany us every day, and that often affect us like a black cloud. We have collected our experiences, our emotions and the frustrations of our generation and we have transformed them into a story that has become the starting point for something even bigger: something that speaks of what we all live. Each participant in the project added a fragment of himself and has played a role to transform words into images and images into music.  ---  La protagonista, non ha un nome, è una figura in cui ogni studente si può identificare: sopraffatta dalle proprie aspettative, spesso disattese e di quelle dei familiari. Vive in un continuo stato di ansia per la condizione di valutazione a cui ogni giorno è sottoposta. Lei si sottrae ad ogni forma di sfogo e vive la routine scolastica reprimendo la propria sofferenza, fin quando la preoccupazione per l’incontro tra sua madre e l’insegnante e la bolla di giudizio, in cui si trova rinchiusa, la porta a reagire.  Noise è molto più di un semplice cortometraggio. Nasce dalle nostre aspettative, dalle emozioni che ci accompagnano ogni giorno, e che spesso incombono su di noi come una nuvola nera. Abbiamo raccolto le nostre esperienze, le nostre emozioni e le frustrazioni della nostra generazione e le abbiamo trasformate in una storia che è diventata il punto di partenza per qualcosa di ancora più grande: qualcosa che parla di ciò che viviamo tutti noi.

While the mankind is adding new signs to the traces of the past, I wanted to explore this place and understand those who gave their lives for this aim. Now these places back to the night. The temperature will drop even further. The top of the ocean will be covered with ice again. The birth of a new day will be at least six months later. Who knows, maybe I will be there to welcome the sun on another polar morning.” I intend to take you to far places difficult to reach with my work including my journey to the South Pole, one of the most difficult points to reach on Earth where I went to, observed and lived my adventure, took my photographs and produced my documentary. This challenging frozen geography has an impact on our world, our city, even our home, on our tables. What is it? The global warming and climate change. These terms which we have just begun to hear tell us that something important will happen in the near future, what can happen, how can we counteract it, how can we take measures individually and socially? That is exactly why this documentary was shot. We have made a gruelling, spooky journey to the most difficult place in the world for you. We try to make it visible for you who did not see with eyes and heard with ears. Now, let’s all stop for a moment to think, is our future really in danger? The ice you’re watching is melting fast. The world is getting hotter and warmer. Do you remember the last summer when the record temperatures of the last 200 years, the tsunamis, the floods… that’s all you see because the ice melts? As the ice melts, the natural climate of the Earth disappears, causing the climate to change and the earth to heat up. Does this warming affect only living beings on this continent? No, it’s deeply affecting us. I guess it is not too late for everything, we can do something. We will be protecting ourselves while we’re protecting our nature. So what are we going to do? We searched and present for you. That is how the documentary begins to narrate the journey to the frozen continent to create an awareness for global warming and climate change.",https://vimeo.com/360090818

Interspersed with laughter and screams echo of other voices, on the radio, on television. They announce the State of Emergency in Angola and the number of people killed and infected by the Coronavirus in the world. And in that same world of masks, there is an urgent word: “WHY”. Whether it's a question, whether it's a statement, we don't know. No one will come up with an answer. But the voices continue to echo. They accompany the places, the voids, the silences that do not remain silent. Whether at school, on swings, or in the place where ghosts now live. For those places of absence, where fear roars, where affections are crimes, the real emergency is in the eyes that the masks do not hide. Filmed in the middle of a State of Emergency, using only a smartphone, but hand in hand with the dream and reality, “WHY” does not seek to provide answers. Only the commitment to resistance cinema, courage against fear. To feel again that we are not alone. That we are with others. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G6-TOqiu64

OF PUPPETS & VEHICLES,Germany,Marius,Schwingel,"The film OF PUPPETS & VEHICLES opens up an insight into the bizarre world of the puppeteer scene. The documentary is a travelogue from the perspective of a puppet and is about the fantastic stories of the characters and the people behind them. At the same time, it forms a framework for the political and performative elements of modern puppet theater. The focus is on the storylines of two puppets. Starting with a cooperation between artists from Kinshasa, Melbourne and Stuttgart, a wide variety of characters have emerged. One of them is called Punch Agathe. The basic idea of ​​the project was to create an independent life story for the doll. Beginning with the phrase ""As she cries, she grows,"" she has grown from a pin-sized figure to a 16-meter-tall being. The life story of the doll becomes parallel on the globe and has become an brand due to its great recognition value. Punch Agathe appears in video games, is a hero in Congolese children's books and raises awareness about the corona pandemic in Kinshasa. Another elementary part of the film is the political level of the puppet Money Mouse. The starting point was Viktor Orbán's decision, without regard to democratic processes, to appoint a new headmaster at the Academy of Theater and Film Arts in Budapest. This will take place in 2020 with the occupation of the university by the student body and the resignation of numerous lecturers. The new headmaster is physiognomically similar to the Money Mouse puppet and, to speak from the puppet's fiction, is capable of eating real people. Working with the Hungarian student Helga Lászár, Money Mouse took part in demonstrations and solidarity events across Europe and became a symbol of resistance in the Free SZFE movement. ",

What does it mean to grow up in Italy, today, as an afro-descendant child of immigrants? From North to South, Crossing the color line tells their stories, experiences, and points of view. The documentary was thought as a 'safe space' where Italian afro-descendants could freely express themselves and rebuild together a first-person narrative: a new Italian youth, with a rich identity, complex and sometimes hesitant, talks about roots, self-acceptance, nationality and dual belonging. Beyond the color line, those testimonies challenge the existing idea of 'italianity' and ask to rethink the sense of belonging to a national identity, redefining the traditional geographical and political boundaries, as contemporary Italy now has another face, which also looks like them.",https://vimeo.com/372594253

The project explores how several people, myself included, read the climate crisis and relate to it both in terms of questioning destructive economic and political systems that cause increasing global unsustainability, as well as their own somatic reactions. By means of accumulation, appropriation and incorporation in a recursive and reflective flow, it layers audio testimonies of several people with a consequent exploration of movement by several performers. These words, sounds and movements of the different participants, support the creation of a choreographic vocabulary that is then interpreted by a single body, affected and altered by the relationship with these testimonies, which it incorporates while inhabiting a place build by humans but that is now being re-appropriated by the “other-non-human”.",

Black Light,Italy,Denny,Cecchini,"The story we imagined belongs to a supernatural dimension that exudes from the bowels of an ancient abbey. Every summer the abbey hosts large groups of young people interested in participating in summer camps and colonies. The structure that had once been used as a monastery is now a logistics base made up of dormitory rooms, huge rooms full of lockers and bunk beds.  The protagonist of this story is called Daria, a barely adolescent girl who finds herself having to deal with boys and girls of her same age. At the ""Camp"" you play, study, hike, and sometimes you face experiences that are not always positive. In a large group of young people who are asked to learn to self-discipline, unpleasant dynamics are often triggered in which logic of arrogance and overpower prevails.  Daria happens to be targeted by some girls and suffer harassment. His calm and thoughtful character immediately make him an ideal victim. A victim who, however, is chosen by a ""superior force"" so that he can rebel and restore a providential justice.  Everything happens one evening, inside a dismal cloister, at the base of a dangerous well. Daria's outburst, in tears of frustration, is welcomed by an indefinite entity. Daria finds herself looking at the sky, struck by a light that as in a negative image turns out to be black. A strong energy accompanied by a very strong wind penetrates her spirit, giving her a strange awareness.  A man with an enigmatic gaze, in a parallel dimension, feels a signal. He acts as if he were called to serve a mission. He has a dreamlike contact with Daria, in which he acts as mentor, guiding him towards a difficult path that she still cannot understand.

Telenovela,Italy,Marcello,Mereu,"Telenovela is a short film&video that accompanies the song Televonela by singer/songwriter March.   Telenovela is about my tendency to overfeel and overthink everything. And about my love of hyperbolic metaphors. It’s one of my favourite tracks on the Pop Psychology 101 album, an electro-pop concoction with a splash of Spanish guitar, courtesy of the great Michel Garrido.   Hope you’ll enjoy the track and video and let me know if you can work out what’s going on. It’s a convoluted tale of intrigue, like in a telenovela, indeed. Here are the lyrics:  Telenovela  All of my options are wearing thin,  so I get stuck in a celluloid dream  where I can be who I want to be where there’s no end to my fantasies   All of my notions are vanishing,  I seek some shelter inside this script   I have been writing since I was three trying out variations on the same theme  All of these characters come to my aid incessantly (With their stories, so many tales to tell) Call it escapism, but every time it works a treat (who cares if I’m stuck in some constant daydream)  I’ve been thriving on a love  That is larger than life That shoots me high above  And leaves the whole world behind When the drama unfolds And the emotions run wild  I’ll embellish every minute, wear a scarlet letter Magnify every detail: Straight out of a telenovela  All of my assumptions are running out,  I was so convinced, I had no doubt   that by the time I reached this age  I wouldn’t be playing on the same old stage  All of these fictional characters don’t mean a thing (With their lying, so many lies to tell) Call me delusional, but I still seek sincerity (who knows if I’m ever going to find it here)  I’ve been thriving on a love  That is larger than life That shoots me high above  And leaves the whole world behind When the drama unfolds And the emotions run wild  I’ll embellish every minute, wear a scarlet letter Magnify every detail: Straight out of a telenovela  ",

This experimental film presents the victimized women's personal experience many years ago when the Anti-Harassment and Stalking Law was not established. Trying to learn how to survive after a painful, unspeakable trance of the past. Using afterimages, overlapping images, composite projections and stream-of-consciousness techniques to create an unspeakable trance state of women who are victims of harassment, it attempts to accentuate the vision of vulnerable women's injured subconscious from a male patriarchal photography perspective. This is a film that uses experimental techniques as an indictment and is also a protest film.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMP-wWNQeqE&ab_channel=%E4%BE%AF%E6%80%9D%E5%A6%98

Gift of Life,Canada,Aviel,Kurulkar,"Death and prolonged illness are sensitive topics that are often avoided in society due to the negative connotations associated with them. However, these are inevitable aspects of life, and it is crucial that we confront them and have meaningful conversations around them.  As a filmmaker, I felt the need to initiate this conversation through my film because I believe that people should not shy away from discussing death and illness. By addressing these issues openly, we can help individuals better prepare for such situations and cope with them more effectively.  Many of us live in constant fear of death, which can impact our ability to live our lives to the fullest. Instead, we should acknowledge that death is a natural part of life and focus on making the most of the time we have left. It is important to cherish every moment, be grateful for what we have, and pursue our passions and interests.  In my film, two characters share their experiences and impart knowledge that helps them live their lives to the fullest. Through their stories, viewers are encouraged to embrace life, take risks, and appreciate the small things. By doing so, we can find fulfillment and joy in our lives, even in the face of illness or death. My goal with the film was to inspire people facing prolonged illness and death to stay strong and have a positive mindset that will allow them to see happiness even in their last days.",

It takes viewers through this world of reflections within this space, but the idea is more rooted in emotions, history, nostalgia, and memories. The narrative of the film goes through a day, along different phases and with different mediums. A major objective of the film is to create an eye for observation through reflections. The film encapsulates everyday magic that appears mundane.   The film also incorporates the subjectivity of self relfection as reflections serve as perceptions and interpretations at personal levels.  Welcome to the world of reflections.

Traversing the Reimagined Palestinian Neighbourhood,Jordan,Zain,Wahbeh,"Home to my paternal great grandparents, Al-Manshiyya was a Palestinian neighbourhood that was once situated in the North of Jaffa. It faced a perpetual mass destruction under a brutal Zionist colonial occupation, between 1948 and the present day. To confront the erasures of Al-Manshiyya’s infrastructure, land, and culture, 'The Image as an Archive' was founded as an architectural practice that attempts to virtually reconstruct the most relevant cultural and socio-spatial aspects of this now-absent neighbourhood. To achieve these reconstructions, I referred to an extensive range of scarce photographs and personal testimonies that were collected from interviews and schematic drawings.  Grounded in street level interactions, the following virtual journey not only reintroduces typical Arabo-Islamic design features like window grills and traditional shopfronts, but also domestic furniture that was characteristic of Arab Palestine before the 1948 exodus. It charts an alternative territory, by framing the most up-close and personal rudiments of a once-thriving Palestinian neighbourhood. In doing so, this audio-visual experience aims to address my hometown's destruction from the regional to the material scale, by enabling its audience to experience the neighbourhood’s vernacular past and real-estatised present through contemporary modes of visualisation.

But that call was diverted through Time Paradox on April 3, 2021 to a young man in Dhaka, Bangladesh, far away from America, on a telephone. Interestingly, Grahambell's use of the telephone has gradually increased since the invention of the cellphone. And wireless cellphones have taken place in people's lives! The broken telephone metaphor implies that slowly Cable telephones have become useless due to reduced usage. And the wireless telephone is now used in the metaphorical sense of the device in our hand, the device with which you are now reading the text. ",
Tango Shoes,United Kingdom,Elzbieta,Piekacz,"The film is about two women Rita and Nora.  They live in the same big city not knowing each other, though they come across the same objects: an apple, the heart, lipstick and shoes.  Rita is ‘self-made’ woman but desperately seeks love. She is addicted to tango and the illusion it creates. She is like ‘The little match girl’ from the Hans Christian Andersen fable. After dancing with a Man, Rita throws the silver shoes and leaves the tango club realising she is creating love from an illusion and that’s why she always feels lonely.  The silver shoes are going to be picked up by the homeless woman Nora and they become like a ‘key’ for her. She lives outside of reality, suspended between two words, passive like a leaf. She puts the silver shoes on and enters the tango club where everyone is dancing. She closes her eyes and her dream starts. She sees the stability that she lost and a pregnant Woman dancing with a Man.   This also coincides with Rita’s dream who is now crying. It is a representation of what Nora lost and Rita never had. Those two women are like Yin and Yang, two parts of the same person are coming together in last scene to dance; to get liberated, learning to love themselves first and finding peace in their own hearts.   Cast: Agnieszka Laskus & Magdalena Fajgier Mariano Laplume & Maral Kojayan  Director: Elzbieta Piekacz Script: Elzbieta Piekacz & Agnieszka Laskus Assistant Director: Agnieszka Laskus Cinematography: Victoria Romero Edit: Kamil Dobrosielski Music Supervisor: Mahlon Berv Life Music performed by Alfredo Martin Espindola and Milo Bird",
Object Blindness,China,Hazel,Dai,"People judge things, from other human beings to simple objects, by their appearances. For example, there are “good-looking” and “ugly” people, “fat” and “skinny” people. Things are first placed into some kind of specific category, and judgments suited the system come along to evaluate the “value” of the particular thing. This project discusses the particular idea by using the mathematical concept called “topology.”  There is a joke in maths that a coffee mug has the same kind of shape as a donut when put into a topology space. Similarly, in real-life cases, there is a kind of disease called agnosia, with which people cannot categorize objects.   ",

Each act is comforted by an intermission of found footage: herds of horses running in pastures and a man speaking fondly of his deep admiration for horses, providing us the perfect model for the practice of care.

The Waste Land II: SALT,China,Qin,Zhang,"The Waste Land is a trilogy of works on the risks of modernity and the crisis of subjectivity, inspired by modernist poet T.S. Eliot's poem of the same name written in the aftermath of World War I and the global depression that has prevailed for nearly three years since the outbreak of COVID-19 in the winter of 2019: wasteland-like urban landscapes, disease and death reduced to “stories” and “scenes” in media spectacle, growing social atomization and spiritual dilemmas, the dysfunction of reason, economic depression and political conflicts......The global crisis triggered by the epidemic is different from the spiritual void and moral decay of the post-war world depicted by the modernist poets of the 20th century, but points to some more insidious threats, such as the “backwash” of entertainmentization, the obscuring of the hidden worries of modernity by industrial prosperity, the increase of global risks and the corresponding turmoil of individual fate. In this project, ""waste land"" has to two meanings: first, the waste land as an physical entity, i.e., a state of societal blockade in which people and their activities have plummeted and thus the cities have become a wasteland; second, the modern individuals who have become a wasteland - a metaphor for a subjectivity deprived of modernity and its risks, for people who are trapped in the iron cage of modernity. SALT is the second chapter of the trilogy, focusing on Karma, the ups and downs of history, the changing social landscapes in modern society, and the survival of mankind under the crisis of modernity. Salt is always a symbol of purification in the cultural systems of different regions of the world, and in this project, it also suggests a search for truth and authenticity and an attempt to return to purity. In this digital art video made up of CG technology and location shooting, the baby and the skeleton, each as the symbol of life and death, slowly pass through the entire history of human civilization and the inexhaustible river of life. What SALT tries to explore is not only the risks of modernity and the crisis of subjectivity, but also how can we - in the modern wasteland exposed by the epidemic - re-think the value and meaning of being a Man: where we come from, where we are going, and what defines us. In the eternal wasteland of time, how can we return to the truth and purity of the universe through all the complexity.",

re.azioni,Italy,Dominic,Sambucco,"Re.azioni is an experimental short film created from archival footage of AAMOD. The film is based on the dialogue between two types of images: colorful nature documentaries and black-and-white shots of hands and faces. Re.azioni is a film about creation and perception, but it leaves many paths of interpretation open. In addition to the meanings that each viewer can find, it is an invitation to contemplation, listening, and feeling.  The film is divided into three parts, each depicting a primordial component of the Earth. The first part portrays the creation of our planet through volcanoes, geysers, and explosions, interspersed with gesturing hands (those of Pasolini) and female silhouettes against naturalistic backgrounds. The second part depicts the ocean through the eyes of an observer, a man with black eyes who watches the underwater passage with wonder and anguish. The final part represents life: a bird in flight, a falling seed, and vast forests are interspersed with hands marking time. The rhythm progressively accelerates to a climax where frames from the first two parts appear. The film concludes with an image of the Earth seen from space.   Every time we act, we influence the world around us and change its form. But at the same time, the world reacts back to us and influences us in turn. It's a continuous cycle of mutual transformation that is inherent in the very nature of existence.",

Another festival would be the “Navaratri” festival celebrated by Hindus. The flow and story of the documentary is led by mainly the answers we gained from interviewing of five interviewees: a Taoist temple’s chairman, a Taoist Medium, a Buddhist Master Monk, a Hindu Priest, and a Spiritual Guru.  Other than that, we briefly feature opinions of the public regarding both the Navaratri and Nine Emperor Gods Festival. Thoughts and opinions from these interviewees would be incorporated in the documentary to give an in-depth understanding towards these festivals, as well as bring into view the aspects of these festivals and the parts of these religions that are similar. The final part of the documentary will focus on the nine stars (from the origins of the Nine Emperor Gods) and the nine planets (the Navagraha that related to the Navaratri), and whether there is a unity between them. This documentary aims to answer as many questions as possible regarding these two nine days festivals, as well as show the connection between these festivals as well as these religions. ",

THE BREATH,Canada,derya,ozparlak,"Derya Ozparlak  Title: The Breath Stop-motion Time:1m07 Year: 2022 Rendered at 1920x1080 24fps (on 2s) as an mp4  Captured by Dragon Frame software Sound: freesound.org   I  have created an experimental stop-motion piece that demonstrates how my approach to animation incorporates ecologic themes and the crisis of global warming.  Therefore, in this animation process, I utilized soil, pine needles, leaves, and rotten rose petals. Organic materials symbolize Mother Nature. The rotten rose petals represent the alarming danger to the environment and Earth, whereas the seeds represent birth and rebirth. For the opening scene, I focused on the theme of breath.  The first scene starts with the soil, seeds, and pine needles. The soil is breathing heavily and exhaling deeply. I arranged the seeds in a soldier-like motion, lined up in order.  Later, everything spirals out of control. I show this through randomly scattering the seeds. For this scene, I used the ’80s Atari soundtrack to highlight the flowers’ restlessness and stress because the soundtrack alludes to when the natural variability of the Earth's climate started to transition. This transition was a result of human-produced greenhouse gas emissions that are leading to warmer temperatures; increased melting in Antarctica, Greenland, and other regions; and a steadily rising sea level.  In the last scene, a single, old tree tries to take a deep breath. However, it freezes, like a computer freezing while playing an Atari game. This conclusion symbolizes how overconsumption is killing the planet.

Meliades,Greece,Domenica,Varvalouka,"This video tries to give the atmosphere of an enchanted forest and to immerse the viewer in it, with a strong emphasis on the dark, eerie and mysterious element. The audio work, which accompanies the video, aims to make the atmosphere more intense and to give the impression of creatures that may exist in this forest. An attempt at mysticism and an attempt to impress hidden entities in the shots. The still shots with the slightest movements, make the viewer look in the image for the hidden creatures that sing and wait in the forest. The inspiration comes from the Greek stories and myths of the folk tradition and mythology about Dryads. The project started with a collection of shots that simply fascinated me as images and with the main goal of searching the clay of the underworld for a project of another lesson. Later I watched the first feature film of Minos Nikolakakis, ""Entwind"" and I was even more carried away by the dark atmosphere of the legend. The name ""meliades"" refers to a category of Dryads that we meet for the first time in Theogony. Meliades or Melies were nymphs of the forests, daughters of Uranus and Gaia, born of blood and pieces of Uranus that fell to earth after being cut off by Cronus. According to some myths they are creators of the mortal race, while according to others, from them came the ""bronze race"" (the third that is) that inhabited the earth, which disappeared because it was cruel and warlike. Legend has it that they lived on linden trees, which they used to make death knives as a reminder of their blood birth.",

Izanagi holds him in her arms and gives him the name Susanoo. Izanagi hears another scream after a moment. The second child is on his way. He eagerly waits for the next child. He looks at his amulet, which he always wears around his neck. A crack will appear on it. Suddenly he hears an explosion from the room where his wife is giving birth.

The spirit of Amaterasu shows what is happening. Amaterasu is frightened and immediately sets out to help her brother. Susanoo alone is not enough for an eight-headed Orochi.

Susanoo draws his sword and looks at him. It's the Kusanagi sword. As a thank you for saving his life, the sword gives Amateras in recognition.

THE WALK,Italy,luca,Belmonte,"An experience, a journey... that I have wanted to capture for a long time. Trying to  express the infinity of emotions that a 2-minute freediving walk at a depth of 15 meters can give. It was more of a mental challenge than a physical one, which allowed me to overcome a big limit. When you find yourself holding your breath for a long time at important depths, the body is put to the test by the temperature that drops drastically, and by the pressure that compresses the lungs to the size of an orange. Heart rhythm slows down to half of normal. And most of the blood flows from the limbs to the ribcage to better oxygenate the body. The mind empties and thought is reduced to the bare essentials that serve to maintain lucidity to return safe to the surface. The hunger for air, or the desire to breathe, never leaves the freediver's mind, not even for a second. But with the right training, this need can be consciously put aside through concentration and willpower. When you dive, you have to forget that you are a man to be free, and abandon yourself totally to the laws that govern this incredible world.  Good vision ",

"Light and Cold Conversation - Atlantic, Algorithmic and Visibility",China,君陶,杨,"At the end of the last century, Detroit music producer team Drexciya fictionalized the underwater race Drexciyans, believed to be the descendants of ""thousands of pregnant African slaves who were thrown into the water along with dangerous cargo due to illness on a ship bound for the United States"" and eventually acquired the ability to live under the sea.  This film references and expands this imagination, envisioning a future of technological advancement supported by artificial intelligence. Here, Drexciyans and artificial intelligence re-examine the recent history of mankind and once again refer to the political economy and the politics of representation in digital infrastructure and images circulation.  AI assists in the more efficient exploitation of resources while using them to meet the expanding infrastructure (computer clusters, storage devices, cloud computing devices, etc.) behind which planetary resource consumption, unfair African digital labor, and loud noise are deliberately hidden, continuing to shape the transparent and sanitized public image of computing technology. On the other hand, the way the sensor samples and the circulation of the image bring noise, and the compression algorithm determines the ""blackness"" part of the sacrifice is greater, the lack of more information, more distortion.  In Africa, many black workers are being subjected to low wages and great emotional exploitation, removing sensitive, violent and illegal elements from AI algorithms. However, until it was exposed by the white Western media, no one mentioned this part of the group. These black laborers, like those black infrastructure, have their faces and voices deliberately hidden in order to satisfy the pure and transparent imagination of artificial intelligence (this description with clearly fascist characteristics).  Further, Drexciyans questions the contemporary human definition of ""representation,"" which makes clear and unambiguous images more popular and unambiguous images aesthetically and morally disadvantageous. The contemporary image world excludes the representation of black people in the name of technology, on the one hand, the backwardness of the film production and projection system on the African continent, and on the other hand, the shooting technology has been aimed at white people from the beginning, and has failed to solve the problem of black identification. Drexciyans suspects that the Western film festival system has played a role. For a long time, these festivals have disparaged images of black Africa and directors from black Africa in terms of visibility. The guests on the red carpet are always noble white people. AI seems to be able to produce scripts about black Africans, but in various ways it deepens the exploitation of black Africans, and fundamentally, AI only takes blacks to the opposite of high-profile film festivals: transparency.

This body is tied to my walk and my solitude has been an essential part of that path. Solitude is the state of being pleasantly alone for a period of time; for a single female artist, solitude can play an important role by providing a space for introspection, reflection and exploration of new ideas. Through my work, I seek to examine the ways in which physical touch and emotional isolation intersect, and how this intersection can affect our self-experience. I created a piece that capture the intimacy and vulnerability of self-touch. I navigated the sensations and emotions that arise from the act of caressing oneself, and how these sensations and emotions are magnified in the context of solitude. This videoart pretends to contribute to a broader conversation about the power that comes from connecting with oneself in solitude.",

She escapes every form of outburst and lives the school routine by repressing her suffering, until the concern for the meeting between her mother and the teacher and the bubble of judgment, in which she finds herself locked up, leads her to react.  Noise is much more than a simple short film. It comes from our expectations, from the emotions that accompany us every day, and that often affect us like a black cloud. We have collected our experiences, our emotions and the frustrations of our generation and we have transformed them into a story that has become the starting point for something even bigger: something that speaks of what we all live. Each participant in the project added a fragment of himself and has played a role to transform words into images and images into music.  ---  La protagonista, non ha un nome, è una figura in cui ogni studente si può identificare: sopraffatta dalle proprie aspettative, spesso disattese e di quelle dei familiari.

Lei si sottrae ad ogni forma di sfogo e vive la routine scolastica reprimendo la propria sofferenza, fin quando la preoccupazione per l’incontro tra sua madre e l’insegnante e la bolla di giudizio, in cui si trova rinchiusa, la porta a reagire.  Noise è molto più di un semplice cortometraggio. Nasce dalle nostre aspettative, dalle emozioni che ci accompagnano ogni giorno, e che spesso incombono su di noi come una nuvola nera. Abbiamo raccolto le nostre esperienze, le nostre emozioni e le frustrazioni della nostra generazione e le abbiamo trasformate in una storia che è diventata il punto di partenza per qualcosa di ancora più grande: qualcosa che parla di ciò che viviamo tutti noi.

Yehiy'e Tov,Israel,Michelle,Boginski,"Experimental film telling a story of forbidden love between a Jewish girl and a Palestinian guy which reveals family secrets and deep fears. I found myself operating within the boundaries of family cell secrets, by examining the standards of culture, time, and identity. throughout the film, I scrutinize conventions and social norms that have been neglected or shaped by “Israeli culture” over the years, holding on to memories, photographs, and objects from the 1990s post-Soviet “aliyah” (immigration to Israel). By using personal and collective archival materials such as vocal documents, objects and cultural motifs, I create staged scenes and acts using various editing techniques that lean on the seam between comedy and tragedy. Through the skills of composition and editing, I manipulate between genres in an attempt to blur the line between reality and fiction. This film seeks to challenge the viewer’s conception of reality and presents ironic and playful language with a critical observation of life in Israel through my point of view.",

Point By Point Poem by Tahirih,Spain,Lauren,Pray,"Tahirih was born in 1814 in Qazvin, Iran. She was an influential poet, women's rights activist and theologian of the Bábí faith in Iran.   A significant event took place in 1848. This was the Conference of Badasht organized in part and financed by Baháʼu'lláh. The purpose of the conference was to initiate a complete break in the Babi community with the Islamic past. There was another purpose of the conference which was to find a way to free the Bab from the prison of Chiriq.   During the conference, as an act of symbolism, she took off her traditional veil in front of an assemblage of men and brandished a sword on another. The unveiling caused shock and consternation amongst the men present. Prior to this, many had regarded Táhirih as the epitome of purity and the spiritual return of Fatimah, the daughter of the prophet Muhammad. Many screamed in horror at the sight, and one man was so horrified that he cut his own throat and, with blood pouring from his neck, fled the scene. Táhirih then arose and began a speech on the break from Islam. She quoted from the Quran, ""verily, amid gardens and rivers shall the pious dwell in the seat of truth, in the presence of the potent King"" as well as proclaiming herself the Word al-Qa'im would utter on the day of judgement.  The unveiling led to accusations of immorality by Muslim clerics of the time and later by a Christian missionary. The Báb responded to the accusations of immorality by supporting her position and endorsed the name Baháʼu'lláh gave her at the conference: ""The Pure One""  Before her death she declared: ""You can kill me as soon as you like, but you cannot stop the emancipation of women.""  This poem ""Point by Point"" is a famous poem of Tahirih's. ",

The leading character, Evelyn, was only eight years old when her mother passed away from a car accident, and since then she has been unable to move on from the tragedy. Despite growing up, she remains fixated on memories from that period. Leaving her with a serious mental disorder that causes her to relive experiences from one day repeatedly.  The story is based on my own true experience. My mother passed away when I was young, yet the strength of my desire to see her again hasn’t waned. For individuals who have endured similar losses what they want the most is to have the experience of their loved one returned to them again. Making things worse is a societal expectation for them to act normal as if things are alright, and to gather oneself together on society’s timeline, instead of one’s own. Evelyn’s life mirrors a mayfly, whose brief lifespan encompasses a single day. Despite its fleeting nature, Evelyn finds her own way to re-live cherished moments with her mother through her illusions and fantasies. The knock at the end of the story holds different interpretations depending on each audience’s understanding. I believe no matter who is behind the door, Evelyn is deeply loved by them.   ",

Rural to Urban Migration in Bangladesh,Bangladesh,Sayed,Himu,"Rural to urban migration is a phenomenon that has always been prevalent in our nation. The consistent and steady rise in this form of migration has also given leeway to a rise in centralization as the country’s major cities are being flooded by an influx of people from different divisions and districts. The focus of this project is to shed light on the adverse effects of this migration in Bangladesh and what could be the possible future if this continues to grow in the upcoming years. The documentary will highlight some of the ways in which this large-scale migration affects the population of Dhaka and Chittagong as well as the economy and infrastructure of the country’s major cities.   Rural to urban migration has always existed in our nation but has recently gained more momentum after the Coronavirus pandemic. The effects of this migration are not felt directly or immediately but rather over a longer period of time and with small but sharp hits for both the national economy and its people.   The purpose of this documentary is to remind and educate people on these effects and how they can lead to an overall decrease in the standard of living. The documentary also aims to showcase the urgent need for decentralization of human capital, resources and economic activities. Decentralization can lead to an overall spread and fair allocation of resources which can help reduce the need for rural to urban migration.  ",

Tales_From,United Kingdom,Joseph,Whitmore,"'Tales_From' is a silent film about a digitally created marionette puppet and its journey to self-awareness. Inspired by the Pygmalion myth, 'Tales_From' explores themes of control and love and their link to the hidden mechanisms that guide human behaviour.   ‘Tales_From’ has been written in collaboration GPT-3. GPT-3 is an autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. Using the 'playground', the text is entered into the terminal and a response is outputted by GPT-3 based on what is inputted. It can answer questions, provide text analysis, converse, and style transfer.  A variety of texts were inputted into the playground, and GPT-3's outputs were used amongst human writings by Joseph Whitmore to create the intertitles of the film. This process also influenced the direction of the animation and, at times, GPT-3 played the role of the puppet, giving it a voice.  Digital technology was also utilised in creating the score. Musical notes were generated by a specially designed program by Joe Beedles and Joseph Whitmore. These notes were based on the luminosity of the frames of the film - for example, the brighter the pixels, the higher note. This was generated in real-time and fed into live music software Ableton, effectively creating a live score for the film much like how films were presented in early cinema.",

Hanged nose,Latvia,Erika,Danilovicha,"""Hanged nose"" is part of a personal diary, excerpts from memory, lived situations and experiences, and just slippery observations. In general, this is about what was going on in the author's head while the body hid itself in the light and dark corners of the city. The film is a transformation. Transformation of reality, experience, observations, hatred, love, anger, and everything that occurs in life (even ordinary things such as a glass, a vase, socks). It is the transformation of reality through one's own consciousness.  This is a tape that was born inside, but under the influence of the outside. This is perception. Technically, the film is undergoing a complete visual transformation. Pieces and edges cling to each other, layers and textures draw new shapes, and colors overlap to create something completely new. The author used various objects, materials and techniques in order to independently create a visual transformation. However, the whole transformation is held together by the VHS camera, combining completely different parts of the experiment (the entire film was shot on the VHS camera, however, other cameras were used for the initial frames, but 90% of the initial frames were also shot on the VHS camera).   Simple editing, monotonous music, melancholic mood, sensual text, quiet extravagance, 90s aesthetics, ""home shooting"" and self-created effects, this is what characterizes the author's style at the moment. I would like to mention that in the visual transformation the author uses the formula of delicacy, simplicity and freedom to introduce the viewer into a light ""trance, hypnosis"". ",

Feel Amazonia ,Brazil,Sammy,Fernandes,"Deforestation, land invasion, illegal mining, climate change, and conflicts with the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) are topics that frequently surface in the mainstream media. Most of these stories, however, are romanticized, decontextualized, conflictual, and violent. They are knowledge-based stories; while people may know about them, they do not help make them feel. And without feeling, there is no action. In this non-empirical approach mixed with personal encountering, I lay down concepts from anthropological viewpoints of decentralizing the human to create a feeling-narrative of belonging, since people are more prone to engage in support of research funds and legislation once they are actively connected with the issues at hand themselves — usually after encountering, in a non-explorative way, the land. To accompany this story, intending to incite feelings from my audience of Amazonian locals and non-locals humans of Earth, I transcribe this story into an audio-visual documentary that challenges anthropocentrism through personal encountering in the world’s largest tropical rainforest, specifically in Porto Velho-Rondônia, which, according to the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), is one of the four most deforested states in the Brazilian northwest region. This film was made in hopes that people feel Amazonia and start to visualize nature as an equal and not as an endless natural resource commodity.",

Masked Depression,"Korea, Republic of",Aaron,Kim,"In modern Korean society, there is a prevalent psychological condition among young people that is described as ""masked depression"" by psychiatry. This condition involves the use of a metaphorical mask to conceal one's emotions.  The severity of youth depression, which is not often acknowledged in our society, is evident in the prevalence of ""Pro Ana"" behavior, where students obsess over unhealthy beauty standards, ""self-harm"" as a coping mechanism for mental anguish, and severe depression leading to cognitive issues and defiance of social norms and laws. Adding such “criminal offense” behavior that defies societal norms in the film highlights the significant severity of adolescent depression, a problem that is often overlooked in our society.  Each teenager's story in the film recounts their struggle with depression and journey to recovery, emphasizing the importance of receiving attention and empathy from family, society, and those around us who are dealing with similar psychological issues. The film ultimately proposes that resolving the issue of adolescent depression can be achieved by addressing childhood depression and filling the gaps in a child's development. ",

UFO: They are already here,Poland,Beata,Migas,"""UFO: They are already here"" is the first Polish documentary about UFO phenomena. The production leads the viewer through the consecutive stages of the investigation carried out by the film crew in order to determine, what really happened in Wylatowo in the years 2000-2006. Interviews with the greatest figures of the Polish ufology scene, such as Janusz Zagórski and Robert Bernatowicz shed a completely new light on the subject of UFOs in Poland. Thanks to numerous meetings with witnesses and the collection of a large amount of previously unpublished archival materials, there was created documentary, which deals with unexplained phenomena in a scientific and reliable way. ""UFO: They are already here"" reveals the intrigues, conflicts, results of research and scientific experiments, which had been hiding for years by the esoteric industry. The combination of these three elements allows us to fully understand the background of physical anomalies, such as time fluctuations, decline of natural radiation or signals of unknown origin, as well as, to determine the origins of the mysterious balls of light and crop circles observed in Wylatowo. Since the subject of widely understood unexplained phenomena causes extreme reactions, as often as not, the only people, who explore this field belong in esoteric community, which uncritically accepts almost every uncommon manifestations. Director Beata Migas decided to go beyond such narration and look at the matter of UFO objectively. She gathered extensive evidence from the Wylatowo - Polish Roswell, including scientific research, archive recordings and interviews with witnesses. All of this in combination with journalistic investigation resulted in a documentary, which deal with all the myths surrounding the UFO phenomenon in Poland once and for all. As a matter of fact that, there are no scientists who want to study this issue with conventional methods till now, it was impossible to deal officially with the subject of unexplained phenomena. Universities must not risk losing their reputation by engaging in activities balancing on the verge of pseudoscience. As a result, the only people participating in the search for truth are amateurs, who define themselves as ""ufologists"". During the production, film crew immerged into the Polish esoteric industry and revealed the surprising connections between New Age philosophy and UFO phenomena.",https://vimeo.com/520866654

 The castle of Ioannina ,Greece,PANAGIOTIS,GEORGOULAS,"There are many researches and studies regarding the founding of the city of Ioannina. We do not know for sure when exactly the city and the Castle were founded, nor of course how the name came from. It is said that it was founded by Justinian in 530 AD. However, this theory was based on a wrong identification of the city with the place where, according to the historian Procopius in his work On Buildings, the inhabitants of the ancient Thesprotian city of Evria moved.  Today we know that the place that Prokopios describes is not Ioannina. In addition, the lack of archaeological finds from that time and other historical sources, leads us to the first documented reference to the city, the year 879, in the minutes of the Council of Constantinople. Zacharias of Ioannina is mentioned as the bishop of the city.  As for the Castle, the first reference is found in 1082 by Anna Komnini in Alexiada, where she refers to her fathers wars with the Normans and the conquest of the castle by Boemund.  In 1204, Angelos Michael I founded the Despotate of Epirus and completely repaired the castle, while another reference is found in the Chronicle of Moreos where he says specifically that Ioannina was a very strong castle surrounded by a large moat. Finally, since 1367, the ruler of the city is Thomas Prelubovic, who repairs the walls of the castle and adds towers to it. In 1430, after capitulation, the Castle was handed over to the Turkish Sinan Pasha and from then until 1913 Ioannina is under Turkish occupation.",

Though Subir and his family lives in a very remote village (Sundarban) of West Bengal, but he a man of progress. Subir wants her daughter to be educated just like every other girl in Kolkata. For Subir, the meaning of progress is to get out of his village and getting settled in the city of Kolkata. His highest priority in life is to see her daughter speaking English fluently.  Tutul on the other hand is very fond of trees. She used to plant small trees on the courtyard of her house. She is a very smart and sensitive child. She learn things very quickly.   Subir’s family condition is not good. He is a fisherman by profession, but he don’t want to do fishing for the rest of his life. Subir is struggling with monetary problem, the school has even rusticated his daughter Tutul because Subir was unable to pay the fees for six months. Only Amar Sir, a young gentleman from Kolkata, who had a posting in this village as a school master, is fighting for Tutul’s re-admission with the school authorities.   Meanwhile, Subir discovered a note (letter) from his grandfather written to his father about a hidden treasure that he has kept somewhere beneath their own land during 1971 Bangaldesh liberation war. After discovering this note, Subir went crazy. He was so obsessed with this idea of hidden treasure kept by his grandfather that he digged all of his land and house, but, he found nothing. Slowly in greed and hope Subir started loosing his sanity.  In the middle of all these, Subir meets Shefali Gupta, Managing Director of Peters company. Shefali offers Subir a handsome amount of money in exchange of all his lands and ponds, as Shefali’s company is going to build a factory production unit in the village, for that they need these lands.  Subir falls in his trap, as he is now desperate to get out of this village with his wife and daughter. He gives all his consent and property papers to Shefali’s in exchange of a job as labour in Kolkata and few lakh rupees. Subir lost the hope of getting his grandfather’s treasure. Meanwhile Amar Sir’s constant fight with the school authority for Tutul’s readmission is successful. The school authorities agrees to take her back to the school, but now, Subir is reluctant to get her daughter in that school as he thought after taking the money from Shaymolendu he would be able to teach his daughter in some English medium school in Kolkata.  This madness of his father effected Tutul psychologically.  And thus, she planted a Money plant (Taka Gach) in the courtyard of her house so that her family can gain some money, as there is a myth that Money Plant can bring wealth to a household.  Meanwhile, Manashi (Subir’s wife) died of tuberculosis.   Now, Subir has no reason to stay in that village after his wife’s demise and finally decides to go out of the village selling off everything at a very low cost to Shefali.   Thus, after selling everything to him, Subir and his daughter leaves for Kolkata in the hope of a better future. Shefali’s company started digging Subir’s house and suddenly one of the worker stabbed the TAKA GACH planted by Tutul just to find out Subir’s grandfather’s hidden treasure beneath the ground. ",

If the society limits her likings while fulfilling her own desires without bothering anyone - would she sit down and remain silent? Will she raise her voice against the society and reform? Will there be a cure or will other birds eat the fish but only the name of the ‘Queenfisher’ will be known in future (“Xokolu soraiye maas khai, Masruka i naam pai!” - an Assamese proverb)?",

Mind Control Attempt No. 1,Canada,Erin,Audley,"My film ""Mind Control Attempt No. 1"" is part of a series of short films designed to evoke specific sensations. This film is meant to challenge viewers' sense of bodily control, creating a visceral experience of needing to use the bathroom. The film layers a variety of images and sounds to create a both sense of urgency as well as tedium, in order to create an overall sensation of discomfort. The sound design plays a critical role, initially calming the viewer with the sound of a heartbeat and breathing, before shifting to the overwhelming sounds of running water. The imagery is carefully crafted to support the sound, creating a visual language that reinforces the sensation of needing to use the bathroom. Ultimately, my intention with ""Mind Control Attempt No. 1"" was to challenge viewers to confront their own bodily sensations and to reflect on the power of suggestion and perception. I hope that this piece will inspire viewers to approach their sensory experiences with greater curiosity and awareness and to consider the ways in which their perceptions of the world can be shaped by external stimuli.

It is an inner conversation with the painting of a young woman in a museum full of depictions of female bodies and character traits, all of which were drawn by men. It brings up various projections like ""..whatever I touch gets lonely"" and subtly exposes the myth of the 'femme fatale' as a male projection.  The video consists of three different components 1) analogue scenes of the singer in Istanbul and on Burgaz Island shot with a Lomokino camera on 35mm film 2) surrealistic stop motion scenes shot digitally in a photo studio 3) abstract scenes of jellyfish and light effects on analogue film that were animated in the editing process.  The video shows the singer disappearing into crowds in the city of Istanbul or asleep in a surrealistic dreamscape. It is supposed to show the passivity and numbness such popular narratives eventuate in for its subjects and inspire a search for their own intuition.

There are stories that repeat themselves, choices that repeat themselves, and what saves us from pain may be, within us, in the struggle that we undertake against our own fragilities in order to frantically remain anchored to life, or outside us, in the thin thread that binds us to others, to those we love or to those who, even though in concept alone, have experienced our same suffering, to those who have giddily balanced on the ledge just as we have.",

Memoir of Melting Blue,India,Sourabh,Anant,"Memoir of Melting Blue Memories… The present and future seeks the way from past moments through an umbilical cord. In the reverse mode thousand times a day, we see through those memories to learn and unlearn. But liberation from the memories of love seems impossible. Love - that can’t be erased from your existence once it has touched you. In that difficult and painful effort of once a lover to unlearn, erase or whatever one can relate to, ‘Memoir of Melting Blue’ is just a poem. Plot Poem, letters and memories – crushed and scattered…  A lover sends the paper boat to his beloved writing a poem on it. “He asked her to see the moon but she doesn’t see the moon for months.” Now crushed and scattered herself, she wants to be free from those memories. She wants to erase every word and return the paper boat back.  Craft notes  Several times in a day and uncountable times in a lifetime, we get into the reverse mode and replay the memories. ‘Memoir of Melting Blue’ is crafted with the desire of a lost lover to go back in time and erase the pain of love, a liberation which is impossible. Thus, the film is completely picturised, enacted by the actor and further edited in reverse that surprises the viewer to identify where the film is going to take them. The visuals with the sound design intend to scratch the cinematic justification to poetry and take us somewhere back in time creating illusion with its aesthetics.   ",https://youtu.be/Via2tDwqxQY

Two Lives,Turkey,Gazi,Gedik,"The man is married with a daughter. His marriage is an arranged one and his wife is a conservative housewife. When he moved from country to town in an attempt to earn his living as a worker a few years ago, city life changed him dramatically. He spents all the money he earned on bets, gambling games and vibrant nightlife. He neglects his own family and starts to cheat on his wife. He often spends the night out and when he comes home he is always drunk. Although he is lively and happy when he is out, he goes round in circles between his family, gambling addiction and the other woman. He even wants to take his wife’s gold necklace when he runs out of money.   DIRECTOR’s POINT OF VIEW  Young people shouldn’t be forced to have a prearranged marriage if they are not ready. When women get married before they have their economic and individual freedom and when they are exposed to violence or cheating, they may not be willing to get divorced because of social pressure or not to affect their kids negatively. They may undergo very harsh conditions during rest of their lives. ",

"""Murphy"" Wojciech Kamerys",Poland,Wojtek,Kamerys,"“I cannot remember the last few days. Everything is blurred, indistinguishable. I remember my mother’s voice on the phone, a voice full of pain, some hundreds of kilometres away from me. Something has changed since then. Something in my head. Something like a filter, a barrier, a cloak that protects the shell from damage at the cost of internal destruction. I’ve been struggling with that ever since. (...) My grandfather died two years ago, two weeks after my wedding. I still visit him once a week, exchange a handshake with the marble tombstone, sit on the bench and talk. I remember the first time, the initial uncertainty and a certain dose of awkwardness changing into a familiar feeling of safety and trust. Sometimes I came here to gather my thoughts, sometimes just to smoke a cigarette, and sometimes to fall into silence. Just behind the gravestone, there is a tree. Its rustle became the silence’s filler, an indistinguishable answer. Soothing and calming. Since then, I have changed my habits, my approach. I stopped demanding, expecting anything. This has helped. But sometimes I still disappear, run away with my thoughts, trying to bury, hide what is uncomfortable. To hide from strangers, from loved ones.”    ""Murphy"" is a short film, a kind of diary documenting the process of getting used to the unknown. It is a portal to events from the past, rooted in the present; shows the connections and dependencies between what was and what is to come; digs up elements of memory hidden for various reasons, often due to emotional burden.

However, she gives him a chance to redeem himself: he must find her within the forest within 3 days. Determined, Cernunnos begins searching through the forest and encounters a young woman who is chained to a tree. Despite his pressing time limit, he stops to aid the young woman, risking his immortality in the service of another. Helping her escape and tending to her wounds, he soon realizes that he has wasted his whole first day. Continuing on his quest, Cernunnos must brave the darkness of the forest for the first time as a mere mortal instead of a god. While running from a pack of vicious wolves, he hides inside a mysterious cabin and encounters the old man who lives there, discovering that he is the first worshiper of a fledgling god that Cernunnos has never heard of: The Great Horned One. Put off by the old man's actions, he attempts to leave only to be attacked by the man who believes that sawing off his horns will save him. Running from the cabin, Cernunnos sees that he has lost another night in his search for the goddess of the forest. Running out of time, he ventures through the forest encountering an inhuman creature. Scared by the similarity between him and the creature, he rejects the being in a violent manner by taking the creature's life. Shaken by this interaction and his diminishing compassion, he finally finds Danu - only for her to reveal that every encounter had been her in disguise and that Cernunnos had failed the trials she had set out for him. As punishment, Danu returns his Godhood - not as the compassionate God he was before, but as Cernunnos: The Lord of Beasts. ",
The colorful black,China,陈,科宇,"《The colorful black》 is an advertisement I created in response to an incident of discrimination against art students in my school. In my school, there were girls who came back to the dormitory at night and were verbally abused by boys from other schools, probably saying that art students are cheap and so on. I also want to use this work to mock the so-called ""cultural people"" who look at art students with colored glasses, and I think we still need to do a lot of efforts on the road to eliminate discrimination in art. The short film pays tribute to the classic scenes in The Godfather to personify the concept of ""art"" and show the opposition between discriminator and art in a surreal way. Colored glasses are used as the external expression form of discrimination. Finally, the destruction of colored glasses is used to show the elimination of discrimination, so as to achieve the satirical effect.",

Motherland,Russian Federation,Michail Lazarev,Michail Lazarev,"In this situation leaving would be appropriate. In reality scary things are happening in Russia right now, you got to understand that we are left without philosophy, we are left on the burnt out library of Alexandria. And there is “no more” Latin. That’s why the film about the last Russian philosopher is about him leaving or staying? But there’s no more fatherland and homeland. Recently I went to a bookstore and asked for Roland Barthes and couldn’t find his work in six shops. That’s why this quite subtraction is only creating moans which we will not hear for years. The shade of the dead which is still spying somewhere. We have made this film when the war has just began. A lot of our friends have left, but I keep meeting philosophers that are being pressed down by this system silently. I do hear their moans and they are bloody. Russia is left without philosophy.  Western philosophy is being destroyed at the root, the one that I have lived by all the years, one that we have been discussing at our evening meetings. The anecdotes of Žižek are simply banned and Umberto Eco is considered simply mad as many others. The true sadness and subconscious generosity relating worlds philosophers passes with lightning speed and almost without a trace like a rain. Like a rain of Mamardashvili. And this one won’t be washed away though.",

Dangerous sun,Russian Federation,Anna,Makeeva,"The Future. The irreparable happened, the sun became dangerous for people. A few people, hiding from sunlight in closets in an anti-radiation house survived. Thanks to a certain Shepherd, they have a chance to stay fed. The Shepherd has the ability to convert energy into a nutritious liquid. Phillip, the main character, is very tired of living in fear, he dreams of freedom, of the sun. In the conditions of the dangerous sun, he looks like a stupid dreamer. He finds in his closet a small sprout that has sprouted in a charming matter. People only come out of their closets at night. The Shepherd constantly escalates the situation of fear and says that if it were not for him and his abilities, everyone would have died. Therefore, everyone listens to him. And they are afraid. The bowel movements of each person should normally be white, if the liquid turns yellow, such a person is sick and he is isolated. Since he loses the instinct of self-preservation and becomes dangerous to society. Today, a certain Vasiliy turned out to be ill, thus banished. On the same day, when Phillip is sleeping in his closet, the closet door opens and he sees a man who is photographing Phillip and hiding. Phillip gets scared at first, but then he becomes curious about who this person is, why the sun did nothing to him or to a person. Phillip looks out of his closet through the crack, but does not dare to come out. At the same time, the sprout in his closet blossoms into a beautiful flower, giving seeds. Phillip tells his wife Liza about everything. Liza refuses to believe, because no one can live under the sun. Phillip decides to come out of the closet in the afternoon and sees a Shepherd who is... awake. Moreover laying underneath the sun, saturating himself with solar energy, while drying his clothes on a rope. Phillip decides to get out of the building to the cliff and plants seeds in the ground. Liza thinks that the mold that is everywhere on the walls makes Phillip hallucinate. Phillip realizes that the sun does no harm, and the Shepherd deceives everyone. Meanwhile, when Phillip pees, he discovers that his urine is yellow. This means that he is isolated from everyone. Phillip, horrified, comes out from the cabin, but the liquid surprisingly changes its color and becomes ordinary - white. The danger was gone. In the hall, Phillip notices the face of the man who opened his closet, shortly, the man disappears. Phillip guesses that the liquid is turning white from fear. He learns how to turn the liquid white, remembering a terrible episode from childhood.  When Phillip was sitting at the cliff, suddenly, Vasiliy appears and tells Phillip about the traps and the force fields that the Shepherd planted, that they can’t simply just run away. Phillip and Vasiliy continue to ponder on why would the Shepherd keep people in closets, if the sun is no longer dangerous.  They go up the mountain together to see how many energy trees are working to come up with an escape plan. On the way to the mountain, Phillip breaks down and understands a lot about fear and about his behavior when he is afraid. Phillip climbs the mountain as a different person. Upon climbing up, Vasiliy and Phillip see a field filled with energy trees and windmills,  a lot of them and they are all intact.  Phillip tries to convince his wife and rescue her and her son to freedom. Liza is afraid, does not believe, and flatly refuses to get out of her closet during the day, locking her son with a key. Phillip, knowing about his freedom, makes a choice to stay with his family, he goes out for a walk in the sun, and in the evening returns to his wife and son. Phillip confesses to Vasiliy that he does not want to get out of the Shepherd's lair, he already feels freedom when he sees clouds and can be under the sun. Phillip realized that he could no longer force Liza to believe him, he understands that this is her choice, this is her way to survive. One day, sitting in ambush, Phillip and Vasiliy spot a man who once opened the closet door. A chase begins, the man runs too fast, but ultimately falls into a trap, Phillip and Vasiliy surround him and, threatening with a knife and a screwdriver, force him to speak. They will find out that this person is a journalist who is trying to find out information about fear farms. That they keep people there like animals, scare them and collect white liquid from them - fear. That this fear is being sold on the black market to states and corporations for control. The journalist manages to escape from Vasiliy and Phillip. Vasiliy and Phillip are watching the Shepherd. They see how a courier arrives at the Shepherd and takes away cans of white liquid. The courier spots that Vasiliy and Phillip are free and informs the Shepherd about it via video link. The courier rises into the air and it becomes clear that there are several more such farms nearby. When Phillip stands behind the screen, the Shepherd opens the door. Everyone sees that Phillip's liquid is yellow. Phillip shows courage, lifts the liquid up and turns it white. People are surprised. The Shepherd is stunned. He takes out a flower that has grown on the street. But people start laughing, because many also have such flowers in their closets. Upset, Phillip lowers his hands and accidentally a seed falls into a cup with a white liquid. The liquid becomes blue, life-giving. Randomly, Phillip reveals to all people the secret of making food. At last, Phillip and Liza go out into the sun together, and their skin begins to sizzle, Liza wakes up, realizing it's just a dream, and she's just very afraid to go out in the sun.

The quest of Goulimi's Tulip,Greece,Foteini,Tatsi,"The enigmatic video is a fictional quest for Goulimi's Tulip that takes place in April 2028. The protagonist is a botanist who explores the island of Elafonisos to locate the last remaining Gulimi's tulip, a species of tulip that grows only in very specific areas in Greece and is currently classified as Vulnerable - VU. The video begins with a historical review of the original discovery of the tulip in 1954 by Konstantinos Goulimi, from whom it takes its name, and thus introduces us to the second attempt to locate it after critical climatic conditions such as annual fires due to global warming. Foteini Tatsi, in her video, mixes elements from documentaries, scientific lectures , historical narratives and video art, thus creating a parallel future reality that seems dystopian but realistic. As stated in the video ""most endangered animals and plants are already extinct"" although 6 years ahead this scenario does not seem unlikely as the governments' indifference to protect the natural environment is not a secret. The artist comes to criticize this indifference and to present a fictional snippet of the future as she foresees it. The character of the botanist comes to be identified and deconstruct at the same time as the botanist, thus enriching the viewer with their personal thoughts, moments and findings.  ",

Professor Musa Mateev,Kyrgyzstan,Aizada,Amangeldy,"The documentary film “Professor Musa Mateev” tells about the life and career of the Kyrgyz plastic surgeon - Musa Mateev, known for his work all over the world. The film tells in detail about his development of the “flap in flap” method, which is widely used in modern plastic and reconstructive surgery. Thanks to this technique, Professor Musa Mateev was able to help more than 15 thousand patients, adults and children, in particular, indigent people.  With a simple method, he solved very difficult cases of patients, using a “flap in flap” concept to close large soft tissue defects. This technique is much cheaper than other methods and rehabilitation is much faster. This very method being technically simple and straightforward but reliable allows to help a large number of children and adults with cicatricial deformities around the world, both in well equipped modern operating room and eventually in the field hospital, in rural areas of developing countries. This was the unique achievement of Musa Mateev, which later was called abroad as “Mateev’s method”.   Also, the film tells of his contribution to the development of domestic microsurgery, humanitarian projects he constantly managed to organize to help patients. In addition, the film discloses other methods Professor Musa Mateev used and developed. There were resident students coming to Professor Mateev from all over the world to learn about these methods, moreover, he was invited to teach at universities abroad. Part of the film will be dedicated to the International Congress of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery in memory of Professor Musa Mateev, which was held in August, 2022 in Issyk-Kul lake, Kyrgyzstan.

Little Buds,India,Unnati,Puri,"The documentary film (Little Buds) talks about the most basic right i.e., the right of education, for a girl. Education given to girls, in middle class families, of the villages, is like a privilege given to them, that too, till a certain limit.  Their childhood is at stake, due to gender roles and other biases, which are embedded in them at a young age. The young girls are meant to stay at home after coming back from school and help their mothers in household chores while on the other hand their brothers are free to roam and play, according to their wish. To teach basic skills of cooking and cleaning to children is fine but imposing it only on the basis of someone’s gender might hinder in the growth, development and thinking of the child.   The film talk about, this trap, of a spiral, where these female characters are conditioned to adjust in the social structure of the society, starting from a little girl- Mehak, to a teenaged- Tamana, to the middle aged- Somvati and then finally the old aged- Lakshmi, all of them remain dependent on their father, brother, husband or son. Their aspirations and dreams stand nowhere.  The cycle continues year after year, generation after generation, there might be a few changes here and there but that’s not enough and we still are left far behind. ",
REBIRTH: VOICE OF SILENCE,"Macedonia, the former Yugoslav Republic of",Ilija,Pavlov,"Two questions: Are we alone in the universe or not? Both answers are equally terrifying.  Without providing comprehensive solutions, REBIRTH figuratively and subtly raises issues like man as the most intellectual being on Earth, existence and habits, unconditional love and energy, psychedelia, mortality, and what occurs after death.  The main character, Pavel, is one of the selected few of the unspoiled and mysterious Intelligence that governs us all without our knowledge.  That Intelligence is the fundamental cause of Pavel's isolation, grief, and pessimism.  Ljubljana, the city of darkness, is the main cause of the sense of hopelessness that overwhelms Pavel, awakening memories of his lost love, Kasia.  Running away is not a solution, but Pavel is unaware.   While experimenting with psychedelic drugs, he comes upon the most potent one of them all: ayahuasca.  This marks the start of his demise.  Being unable to explain how much you love someone makes you feel helpless, but at the same time, it reflects absolute love.  Unexpectedly, Pavel hears the melodious voice of Kasia, which he has been wishing to hear for 3 long years.  Right away they begin an intimate and continuous communication about all that has happened and all that is to happen, delving deep into their feelings and emotions.  Ljubljana becomes the city of light for Pavel, and all the places that previously invoked only memories and nostalgia, gain instant presence and meaning like never before. Kasia's presence is his first Rebirth.  Whether Kasia is real or just Pavel's imagination is an issue that is frequently raised throughout the film.  Kasia's appearance does not bring any answers, thus she reveals her dark side and the mysteriousness of those who have created us and left us to wander in search of hope creating a ""PLACE"" where hope dies last.  Pavel is constantly looking for the magical ""place"" where all wishes come true; the ""place"" is genuine and wonderful, but getting there is nearly impossible, and very few people have reached it.  Pavel has no notion what he's getting into and has no answer to the question: How many times do we have to ""die"" to experience a Rebirth?  Shanti, shanti, shanti.",

PMS by Chris Schalko,Germany,Chris,Schalko,"The short film „PMS“ is an emotional approach of explaining and de-stigmatising PMS and menstruation. It’s edited in a triptych called „Cinemiracle“ so that the screen is parted into three squares. The film is semi-documentary combined with emotional artistic fragments. It includes interviews with three women, who talk about their experiences with PMS. In the movie you see these women dealing with PMS. They are lying in their beds, eating chocolate, cramping. You also find pictures of menstrual blood floating in a very beautiful calming way. The film is underpinned with dramatic choral arrangements, that are meant to bring the melancholic mood to the film. In the course of the film the interview fragments layer more and more as well as the pictures of the women so sound and pictures are getting more and more hectic and lout. This is supposed to express the many voices of self-doubt in your head, while having PMS. The only thing that helps to release these voices is, when your period sets in. And that’s how the movie ends.",

I made this documentary in recognition of the great professionalism of all my staff.  I want our experience to serve to make the world aware that we must take care of health personnel so that they can continue doing their job, taking care of us.

Thai(wan) Basil,United States,Chang-Ching,Su,"Olfactory bulb, a structure locates at the front of the brain, manages our sense of smell. It sends information to the body’s central command for further processing. Through this route, aromas go to the limbic system, the parts that process emotion and memory. I use basil in my cooking. However, the food hasn’t smelled the same since I moved to Chicago. I’m thinking about the licorice- and anise-like smell of the Asian Basil that ought to be extracted by high-heat stir-frying. It has been a while that I ask the sweet, peppery, fragrant Western Sweet Basil to do the job in my basil omelet. I know it tried, but the food hasn’t smelled the same. The residual Proust effects, generated by the lack of original material, lead me to explore memory-scapes in urban spaces that accommodate international lost souls who came to find new lives, where every cubicle in a building is a battlefield of the idea of leaving and searching for home. The hybridity of pasts and futures in urban spaces creates a mix and match in culinary rules. While we are all on the quest of finding the flavors we remember and the aromas that are so dear to us, the absence of authenticity has become our common ground. I find comfort in a hypothesis, maybe we find home in those fragile moments of peace shared in coexistence, in common loss, in common gain.",

LA LIXEIRA (the dump) - the invisibles' dignity,Italy,Guido,Galante,"Maputo, the capital city of Mozabimque, has one or may be two million inhabitants. A few neighborhoods have houses or more precisely brick shacks,  some paved roads, mostly a wide range of huts without basic sanitation services, where day by day men, women and children scrape food together in slow and quiet despair-the only chance they have to survive.  In Maputo, not exactly in the city centre or even on the outskirts, there is an area called the dump district, La Lixeira. The dump is a metaphysical scenario, metaphor of our world, so aseptically modern, a kind of reversed utopia of our fate.  About 700 families dig  their way through these new mines of modernism. La lixeira is the place where the tangible and the intangible waste, the human waste, combine together in a visual short circuit. Man himself is reduced to being rubbish. It is a paradigm of the economical, social and existential topographies of our Earth. A sort of peaceful camouflage of despair, a cruel inhumane condition lived by its protagonists with the levity, fatality and irony which are the features of these almost unworldly people. This is Roberto Galante’s honest and true report. Roberto is the creator and manager of educational workshops on photography, graphics and writing called ""A Mundzuku Ka Hina"", a real school for the young people clinging onto survival in Maputo’s dump. ""A Mundzuku Ka Hina"" is a vocational training school which aims to aid in providing employment for the orphans and street children living there. Roberto dedicated the last ten years of his life to the children living on the landfill and to their human and professional development. He put forward a challenging project to kids who have been dealt a difficult hand in life, and otherwise wouldn’t be afforded the opportunity to work or fulfil   their potential. The principle inspiring Roberto's actions was to give skills and competences back to the invisible, the voiceless people , in order to let them  express their  own vision of  the world and become the architects of the narration themselves. After Roberto's death, in July 2019, the organisation has continued to pursue the path that he had carved. The workshop is now carried out by the oldest and most trained students of the school who tutor the youngest, nurturing the flame of their teacher's passion for education and training.    ",

Talent for Coping ,United Kingdom,Nia,Krasteva,"Mental health is a theme increasingly dominating both headlines and our daily lives, and upon the background of an ever-changing world bringing with it ever-changing challenges, questions remain on how can individuals actually approach these issues which they face? Talent for Coping is an exploratory documentary which follows the journeys of two main subjects, Alex and Reece, as they navigate the means of healing, processing, and self-discovery through art. Engaging with Art Therapy Practices - contrary to more traditional therapeutic concepts - encompasses great scope, following many different pursuits and a freedom for self-expression. Throughout Talent for Coping, Alex reflects upon his affection for miniature paintings and campaigns - what this truly resembles for him, both emotionally and mentally. Meanwhile, Reece delves into his devotion to performing & the impacts of show-biz in regards to stand-up comedy; and how often, making people laugh can be one of the loneliest jobs which still requires the need for a smile on the surface. As Talent for Coping traverses across these themes, the film seeks to question to what extent Art Therapy can be used as a form of coping? Where does the line between this and clinical therapies need to be drawn? Or does it need to be drawn at all? With the guidance of registered Art Therapist, Christiane, and the truthful realities of Alex and Reece, this documentary hopes to shed light on these emerging, powerful, and creative approaches which have a big impact on society but until recently have been largely unexplored!

Ishq-e-Risk,India,rupal,poddar,"The film focuses on the idea of love in India where love is inherited to us by Bollywood songs, spun around mythological tales, valentine‟s day celebration, Chetan Bhagat‟s novels etc but falling in love is still fraught with problems of acceptance as taboos around “love” are still intact. The film aims to deal with people who have had to make major life choices because the love and compassion inherited to us became a problem for their family or stigma to the society. Love in India comes with a package of fear and trauma for many. The ones who separate due to acceptance of love, the ones who get beaten up for daring to love and the ones who are killed in the name of honor of family. The idea of love comes with the brackets of caste, class, religion, gender, gotra, disability, etc of the partner. The societal institution and family can deny the love between any two people on the basis of any of these odd brackets tearing apart the basic idea of love. These brackets have been seen to be accommodating within some urban families nowadays but no bracket is big or small as people have even been murdered due to them. However many couples in India are defying traditions and choosing to marry for love, risking social backlash, arrest, and sometimes their lives. The film wants to tell the story of a country where loving can be a foolish mistake at best and punishable crime or murder at the worst. Despite the ideas of eternal love of Radha Krishna and Ghalib‟s shayari flowing in our blood, rage and anger can punish people in love. The film also explores casual sexism and islamophobic or casteist behavior in family structure and liberty of choosing life partner. It also deals with how marriage is a celebration of bonding of two individuals fitting in each other‟s economic social and cultural construct and anything but love. Love is a parted topic in the construct around institution of marriage. It also depicts how being intolerant in India is becoming popular and cool. The film will unfold with a new rendition of the eternal ingredient of literature and cinema: LOVE. And within it another tale of the world that love is surrounded by: HATE.",

Be it politicians, moralists, feminists or activists, everybody got worked up. Even lawyers and gynecologists flooded the field with expert advice. TV channels and police lost their sleep. Investigative journalism on the one hand, guarding performance farce on the other. Amidst all the commotion, Sabita's new announcement that she will publicly auction her virginity in front of the Secretariat has also come out. Mercenary forces lined up on both sides, for and against the sale. Spectators were ready to enjoy the spectacle, police were ready with barricades and water cannons.Judges began preparing judgments in the media rooms. What happens in the anxious hour? Kerala waited with excitement. Violation of personal freedom and privacy has become common in these days. Mutual respect is also gone. Ideology have been reduced to mere words. Today we no longer hesitate to chase the victims and hunt with the hounds. It is in this context that the movie 'Vettapattikalum Ottakarum' is relevant.

Thus in this production, we will try to talk about the paralyzed and frozen side of human Emotions, behavior and reaction. About Poem:- Numb is the solo dance performance. The whole Dance piece is going to be performed on a 'poem' which stands a satire. Talks about the different dark situations of human life. The poem encounters the situations as in the human have become too mechanical these days and have been trapped in his self-made system called society. Character sketch:- This character represents the mechanical side of society as he is working in a corporate, he works in fix hours, he has a particular system, he keeps on doing the same thing every day thus he has his self-made boundaries where he thinks that he is safe. He doesn't want to look at things which is negative for him but here comes the irony that he is not left alone from the dark situations which give him wounds every day he is so scared by the society and the negativity that he feels that if he will shut his eyes then he won't be able to feel the continuous force of negativity but he is wrong. Thus we will try to show the struggles he is going through by Body moments and by the poem which is being written. The Concussion of the story is that though we have too much negativity in our life still, we somehow survive, we don't give up, and we don't end up killing ourselves. ",

Numerous attempts have been made to purge the unseen friend, though none of it has been consented to by Ratri. One night, after Ratri had finished her always-lonely dinner and her mother had just returned from work to join her, Mother caught Ratri staring blankly across the room. She realized there that her daughter's epiphytes were still lingering around, watching them two. Asking Ratri about it, she knew that Ratri had not utterly shunned herself away from the creature. Ratri persists that the guardian has always been a friend and is also God's creation. After getting Ratri's response, mother lost her temper and sent Ratri to her room.    On the same night, Bunda and Ratri practice a prayer for the umpteenth time to repel the guardian. But this time, Ratri can feel that her guardian is becoming weaker. Ratri had no choice other than to follow her mother's wish---to purge her guardian. She knew that if the purging didn't work out, then mother would contact a pastor only to hurt the guardian even more. When the guardian presence starts to dull, Ratri once again tries to convince her mother to let her keep her only friend.",

She spends hours in her lingerie and in front of a camera, reading the Communist Manifesto, offering P.O.V. talk therapy to men with mommy issues, or repeating “5’8 guys aren’t short” until her words become gospel. She earns most of her money from commission videos and is compelled by a certain client named “DickWeasel92” who pays her absurd amounts of money to psychologically degrade him. Over time, Ava forms an online friendship with Dick and grows increasingly concerned with his poor mental health and how her videos might be worsening it. Just as she is about to cut contact with him for what she believes is his own well-being, Dick makes his most insane offer yet: he’d pay Ava’s college tuition for 30 second video instructing him to end own his life. In an age of commodified intimacy and social performance, this film questions how real honest online relationships can be through the overlapping perspectives of two internet friends, audience vs performer, and worker vs customer. As the average person’s well-being grows increasingly at odds with a capitalist economic system, this film explores our personal agency in the emotional and moral sacrifices we make for monetary gain. It also investigates how technology and online performance impact mental health.",

ANTINATALISM,India,Sumit,Mazumdar,"Would it have been better if we hadn't come into existence?  Antinatalism is a philosophical view that considers the reproduction of any sentient life to be morally unjustifiable. But isn't it wrong to oppose procreation? Why would anyone be against creating a new life? Philosopher David Benatar explains in detail the concepts of antinatalism in his book. Benatar argues that anyone who comes into existence will inevitably face some harm, so it is unfair to bring a new sentient life into this world. Therefore not procreating is the best thing we can do for our unborn children because those who did not come into existence will be exempted from the pain of life. Antinatalism is a controversial topic and difficult for many to accept. People are generally opposed to the concept of antinatalism because this philosophy may seem abhorrent and pessimistic about life. When we look at life, we can conclude that there is no such thing as chronic happiness in life but there is chronic pain. Happiness will be a memory and it will hurt you once in a while. i.e, there is no such thing as long-lasting happiness.Benatar also points out that an existing life may be worth continuing, but we all have to think rationally before deciding to create a new life.  Looking at procreation in a positive light, we can say that the child can have many satisfying experiences and even find lasting meaning in his/her existence. But can these contentments of life such as eating good food and listening to beautiful songs be compensation for the inevitable miseries of life? It's probably unfair to impose something on someone without their consent. This is probably acceptable to everyone. Surely you wouldn't think it's fair to force you to do something if you don't want to? There is no opportunity to take the opinion of the unborn child before birth. If opinions could be taken and everything, including religion, society, life struggle, and uncertainty, would have been revealed to the child,  would he/she choose to be born? Although the needs of a woman's and a man's body are of the main concern here, there is a hidden desire between men and women to be a parent, but through this activity, a new person is created.  That is an independent being.  Thus procreation cannot be a personal decision. By giving birth to a child, you not only impose life but also death on that sentient being. Also, the burden of religious, social, family, and life struggles and uncertainties will be imposed (because he/she is unable to protest). So can procreation still be called a personal choice?  If procreation can not be anyone's choice, then what will people do? Giving birth cannot be someone's choice but not giving birth can be a choice. It does not matter to the unborn child if he/she doesn't come into existence (since he/she is non-existent).So can it be your choice to give birth to someone if you accept that it can never be a choice for you or anyone else to decide in your life? You may ask if giving birth is so bad, why does our society encourage giving birth? If procreation is not encouraged then all the businesses associated with procreation will shut down.Politicians want volunteers, factories want workers, religions want to increase their disciples, and capitalists want consumers. The birth of a child means a  new slave for the capitalists, who will relentlessly fight to get the basic needs and will be trapped for a lifetime under the responsibilities imposed by society.The only way out of this vicious cycle is an untimely death. The greatest rebellion against capitalism would be not to create new life.No action or any other form of protest is required. Do not create more slaves for them. Most people claim that  they love children, but those who say they love children use them for their amusement, to relieve their loneliness, to sustain their marriages, and to fulfill their parents' desires of seeing their  grandchildren's faces in their old age. So who are the people who unselfishly love children? The Antinatalists or the natalists? In the Judiciary System, there is a saying that ""let 1000 culprits escape, but one innocent should not be punished"".Likewise billions and billions of children who do not exist but would be happy if born, it does not matter if they exist or not but it cannot be moral to give birth to even one child to suffer the pain of existence without any guilt. Our parents have done wrong by bringing us into this world because we did not come into this world of our own will, and when our parents wanted to bring us into this lamentable world, they did not think about us for a moment, they were busy with their momentary pleasures, Didn't they know how agonizing this world is, where everyone has to risk hundreds of chronic diseases, pain, and agonies at every step of life  before the undeniable painful death? Giving birth in this world is absolutely immoral and grossly wrong. I am saying from my own life experience that as long as a man lives in this world he/she has to live by constant struggle. So, where is the greatness in this pointless rat race? This world cannot possibly be a suitable habitat for any healthy human being to survive. When no man can guarantee his/her child a pain-free life in this ugly world, then no man can have the right to give birth . Do not repeat the wrong done to you. Do not respond to injustice with injustice, because giving life is the worst injustice. Do not disturb the peace of the unborn, let them live in the peace of non-existence. We all have to go back to that non-existence one day, so why just give someone the pain of existence?' Please don't think that we don't love children, we are against giving birth because we love them the most.  ",

Sobhan has a deep love for his wife. It’s a matter of his lifelong sorrow that his wife didn’t get the last wash after her death. The only one who knew about Sobhan's pain was Imam Sahib, his friend of happiness and sorrow. Since the bereavement of his wife, Sobhan Mia used to wash the dead bodies in the area with conviction. He does it with deep sincerity and there is no other motive. In this way many years pass. Then many years later, a new contagious disease appeared. Lots of people are dying around but no one is washing dead bodies for fear of infection. The only one who does the job is Sobhan Mia. Karim Sahib, an influential person in the area, shows his influence and the temptation of extra money to Sobhan to do this under pressure. Sobhan could have avoided his offer during this difficult time but his strong sense of humanity motivates him to do this job. Day after day, he washes many dead bodies affected by the epidemic. Then one day he himself fell ill. A car comes to pick him up in the morning like every day for washing the body but today Sobhan doesn't respond. Imam told Karim Sahib that Sobhan had washed people all his life. Under any circumstances, it is essential to wash his body at least. But the rules are left! While Sobhan washed dead bodies his entire life, at the end he didn’t get the last wash of his life. It is a cruel journey to surrender him to destiny in the same way as his beloved wife. It's like a ruthless journey to the unknown. Heartless Karim Sahib is being overwhelmed to hear this and feeling helpless in spite of strong desire. There are so many people in town but not a single person came to wash Sobhan at this moment. In this scene of the film, the water of the river is flowing along the road. It’s water everywhere but Sobhan doesn't have two buckets of water for washing.  That's right that, death is an eternal truth.

Mourning Cloak,United Kingdom,Joshua,Davies,"A student final year film project. Motion-captured short animation rendered in Unreal Engine 5.  A train stowaway, that suffers from a dissociative disorder, must deliver a parcel to Berlin while avoiding a group of pursuers, the danger of death and her past mistakes.    Mourning Cloak - Synopsis A lone, hooded woman is spray painting on a moving, levitating freight train in the rural Polish countryside. The painter is inked with a black butterfly on her cheek. her graffiti is signed: ‘Jade Amber’. Jade searches through her bag for a camera but when doing so, a photograph slips out of her notebook onto the floor. She examines it. It's of a young couple who have matching butterfly tattoos. They look in love. It triggers a dissociative episode, she approaches the opening of the carriage for air. An out-of-body experience is triggered and she loses control. The train hopper takes a step forward, disconnected from her own body. She hears whispers of past memories, “I miss you”. This grounds her back into reality. She plants herself on the edge of the carriage, recollecting herself. Time passes. Three masked individuals on hoverboards are shown riding alongside the train on hoverboards. The three individuals are part of a militia group searching for a parcel heading to Berlin. The parcel is shown near Jade’s backpack, she is the courier delivering the package. Jade, still inside the carriage, hears footsteps above her. She closes herself into the boxcar. The leader of the masked individuals: Prince, spots Jade beneath them and orders the female of the group, Naomi, to “stop the train”.  The other two, Prince and Lie, intrude into the carriage to find Jade frantically collecting the parcel. Prince threatens to “throw [her] off” the train if she doesn't surrender the package. Jade refuses, retaliates and initialises a fistfight with the two men. The brawl ends with her knocking out Lie and clambering the outside of the train while evading Prince shooting his last few bullets at her. Prince pursues Jade on top of the moving train. Jade fails a landing crashing onto the carriage’s roof and dropping the parcel. Prince catches up, drags Jade by the neck and chokes her over the edge of the train. The near-death experience triggers Jade to dissociate. Just in time, the train comes to a sudden stop, jolting the two characters backwards and opening Prince up to an attack from Jade that indisposed him from the fight. The train stopped above a suspended train, high above a large ravine. Jade spots the last of the three individuals. She runs to pick up the parcel and charges them.  Naomi slickly steals the parcel from Jade and initiates a fight between the two which ends with Jade punching Naomi’s mask off. Jade identifies her rival's face and then calls Naomi by her name. They share the same butterfly face tattoo, she is the girl from the photo. Jade begs Naomi to talk to her team to allow them more time together. Jade tries to rekindle their friendship but to no avail. Jade is disconnected on an emotional level from Naomi, as she is dissociated from her own life. Naomi is still pained by Jade's inability to have connected with her. Naomi refuses Jade’s offers to reconcile and gives her an opening to escape. Jade accepts this offer and hopefully implies she will “see her in a bit”. Jade jumps off the train into the river below. Naomi rushes to assure herself Jade survives. She does not see her.  The rest of the team arrives to learn the woman escaped. Naomi reassures her team they “have the communicator” and with the team, content with this outcome, they plan to return to their home base, “Paris”. Naomi stays gazing longingly at the water where jade landed. She finally sees her ex rise to the water’s surface. Naomi stays staring for a lingering moment, before sequentially, turning her back on her. ",

An interview begins between Jade and two detectives, DCI Jimmy Haliday (51) and DCI Shaun Moakes (38). They begin by asking why does she have no documentation. Jade tells them that she was lied to by the man that trafficked her and that she was promised citizenship. The detectives are stubborn. They begin to ask about the crime why did she do it, did she know the man, etc. Jade’s patience begins to wear thin with them. She feels like these two are not seeing her as a victim. Jade begins to tell her story.  Jade begins with what she was promised by the trafficker back in Vietnam and how bad life was in Vietnam. She goes on to telling them how bad her treatment has been. What this man has done to her. The things she has had to do to other men. Her living conditions. How she would sleep on the streets just to avoid the trafficker and selling her body. When she decided she had to do something drastic to get people to help.  Jade feels like getting arrested has finally got her away from these people, but she will be arrested and then deported back to Vietnam, where she will go through continued troubles. Jade is disposable to the trafficker, who doesn’t get arrested, and replaces Jade immediately.  Another girl, similar to Jade in age, physique, etc, can be seen entering the brothel.

Fractured Narratives,Pakistan,Amadia,Arif,"This project is based on ‘Cinematic Heterotopia’ which Victor Burgin defines as a network of separate but overlapping interfaces and viewing habits.For nearly a century, film was identified with a particular mode of viewing — ‘the cinema’. It has big screens, controlled lighting, rows of seats, surround sound and a means of cultural and economic organisation. The large auditorium of the cinema hall takes its place alongside TV, laptop screen, in-flight entertainment, lobbies, storefronts and mobile phones. The plethora of screens that surround us, make both the spectators and screens mobile and responsively ‘smart’ in relation to each other; completely destabilising the fixed position and physical passivity initially associated with watching cinema from a distance. The impact of this is portrayed through the cinematic experience of three viewers: the viewer of the wide screen of cinema, laptop and the mobile screen and how they migrate from their cinematographic space into the narrative space through cinematic daydreaming. This is a private realm, not available to others unlike the perceivable images and sound of the film. The viewer remains conscious of the reverie but becomes less aware of the perceptible surroundings.  This is a series of short films portraying the eye of the viewer, in watching the same film but in different mediums. How the elements of these platforms affect the viewer experience and help or distract them from consuming the content.   In this contemporary world, we are surrounded by the proliferation of technology to the extent that we lack in experiencing what is required in consuming the content of a film. ",

Dispatches from the Lockdown,United States,Andres,Villarreal,"Dispatches from the Lockdown thematizes the lockdown in New York City during the Covid-19 pandemic, it builds on deep contrasts between the banality and tranquility of empty streets of New York and the contrasting news reports regarding the ongoing covid pandemic, as well as the sudden outburst of massive Black Lives Matter protests, and political actions that were to spread from street to street in the city, ultimately dominating city life completely. The images are overlaid with a voice over text with both essayistic and personal storytelling elements, discussing the passing of time, the human inability to perceive crisis and the need for action in the present moment. The film contains contrasting messages and images. The empty streets are contrasted with powerful images of the same streets full of people protesting for racial justice. The voice over tells the story of human historical inability to take action in a crisis, yet the images seem to contradict this message and point to possibilities of change and to avoid this tragic tradition. The film draws out the uneasy relationship between the city in the midst of a covid crisis, and the deepening sense of gloom and doom as a form of perceptualized tragedy and relates it to previous crises and personal history. The work stresses both the importance of lived subjective experience as well as hard objective facts.  Streaming link (downloadable) https://vimeo.com/569264002 password: dispatches",

Why you are alone,India,Pranabesh,Barman,"For me, and for many of us, our first waking thought of the day is ""I didnt get enough sleep."" The next one is ""I don't have enough time.""

We spend most of the hours and the days of our lives hearing, explaining, complaining, or worrying about what we don't have enough of... Before we even sit up in bed, before our feet touch the floor, we're already inadequate, already behind, already losing, already lacking something. And by the time we go to bed at night, our minds are racing with a litany of what we didn't get, or didn't get done, that day. We go to sleep burdened by those thoughts and wake up to that reverie of lack... This internal condition of scarcity, this mind-set of scarcity, lives at the very heart of our jealousies, our greed, our prejudice, and our arguments with life.... Why you are alone",

Reflection,Pakistan,Ali,Haider,"This movie revolves around a young girl who lost her siblings and became handicapped after suffering a terror attack at their home. The girl cannot escape the horrors of the traumatic incident even in her dreams and usually finds herself in a situation prior to the moment of attack while dreaming. In every dream, she encounters a mirror in which she foresees the events. Mirror provides us with our self-reflection, and it’s a common adage that a mirror doesn’t tell a lie. In mystical literature, the mirror symbolizes one’s inner self, a place where divine’s manifestations can be seen or the ultimate truth is reflected. Indian Persian poets, particularly Bidel Dehlavi, have widely used the image of the mirror as a metaphor with a range of meanings. At times it symbolizes astonishment and bewilderment while at other instances it reflects someone’s longing for a lost vision. Hence we have selected the mirror as a symbol of our protagonist’s past reflections and her fearful astonishment.  Also the situations we have selected symbolically depict the sufferings of our protagonist. The girl finds herself in snowy surroundings in her first dream vision. In modern Urdu and Persian poems, snow symbolizes the indifference of society towards the miserable and the ones living on the peripheries. It also symbolizes the lack of warmth of human emotions for one another. Iqbal has also portrayed winter and snow as the wrath of God and writes that a hell is a cold place and every person there brings with him or herself the fire of their sins. Hence, the snow for our protagonist also symbolizes the indifference of society and surroundings towards her miserable condition and the absence of the warmth of family’s love which is now replaced by the snow of harshness.  Similarly the sand and desert in the second dream-vision portray the hardships this protagonist is going to face in her life head. She will find herself under the burning sun without the protecting shade of her family. ",https://vimeo.com/666462664

mask,China,Kexin,Wang,"The script for ""Mask"" was inspired by the social phenomenon of today, where women and men have a high demand for good looks. From primary school children to middle-aged people, even men are involved. They all have a strong desire to look good. Often they are unaware of the consequences of the so-called beauty tricks that they become addicted to. They are often influenced by online media, or by those around them, which can lead them down the wrong path. The story is a realistic representation of the theme of the story. The theme of the story is a true reflection of the increasing desire for beauty in today's society, which is influenced by the general environment. People want to have the ""elf ears"", the ""snake face"", the need to be thin, to have big eyes and to have a good figure. It can even go beyond normal aesthetics. Just like some people have plastic surgery until they are ""deformed"" and ""transformed"". What the film is trying to show is that the 'pretty' face you think you have at one point in time will not always be with you. It is often what you are given by God, by your parents, that suits you best. Everything should be done in moderation, in control. You cannot let your desires, your indulgences, manipulate you and turn you into a puppet doll. The short film ""The Mask"" tells the audience not to give up and forget who you really are for the sake of a fleeting pleasure. The actors themselves understand and process the film to reflect the current state of morbid beauty and to warn the world.",

Lost mother,Chile,ting,zhou,"Lost Mother tells a story about ""love,"" ""lost,"" and ""healing."" I always want to make a maternal love theme film. The inspiration comes from a joke I used to play with my mom when I was a kid that I was dead, and what she saw was her illusion. Every time I said this, my mom would be furious and bet me, but I did not quite get the valid reason at that time. Growing up, I understood that talking about death is taboo in Chinese culture, especially among children's mouths. Even if actual death happens, people often will tell white lies in the name of love and protection. Adults always self-absorbedly consider children  for not understanding  anything.  On the  contrary, they  do know everything. However, I believe children should have the right to see the truth and make their own decisions because it is the most critical lesson in growing up. One of the most important lessons I have learned from making Lost Mother is time management during shooting. Although I had as much pre-production as a new director lack of experience, I still needed more time to get all the shots I wanted, such as complicated long shots. I realized that I spent so much time on the secondary shots arranged in front of the complicated ones. Also, the shot list should be more specific because I realized several shots I would never use in post-production. If I had made it more specific before, I could save saved more time on set. The other significant lesson I learned is how to work with minor actors. Instead of giving them the explicit direction of their acting, directors should treat them equally as adults because they understand all the subtext and emotions of the story. They can give outstanding performances beyond expectations when they get enough trust from the director.",

The Party,United States,Charlie,Gaston,"Logline: A biracial Black woman sets out to take back her power after a racist attack thrusts her into the world of hashtag activism and renders her the perfect victim.  Synopsis: This is Nia's third therapy session but she hasn’t made much progress. Nia tells Dr. Lilith that politicians today are using racism to distract people of color from the real problems facing their communities. As a black woman, Nia resents being stuck in a paranoia-distraction loop. Dr. Lilith, a white woman, makes it clear that racism is real and deeply embedded within American society. But Nia mocks any assertion of a second coming of the KKK, dismissing it as little more than bad political theater and a cynical way to scare up the all-important Black vote.   Dr. Lilith takes a different approach to try and get through to Nia. She recounts a story about her 6-year-old daughter acting out at school. As a therapist, Dr. Lilith recognized that people often act out when they’re unable to cope with trauma. She comes to the realization that her daughter was acting out because she was having trouble coping with her parent’s divorce. Dr. Lilith warns Nia that she might be behaving in a similarly self-destructive manner and encourages her to open up more about her troubled past. Feeling caught, Nia tells the story of how she was the victim of a hate crime as a graduate student.   Nia lays bare the traumatic impact of being the victim of a racially motivated sexual assault, explaining that once the mainstream media got hold of her story she became little more than a hashtag. She watched helplessly as her entire identity was reduced to a single word: victim. Her attacker went to prison but Nia spent the next five years stuck in a vicious paranoia-distraction loop that left her feeling revictimized.   Dr. Lilith finally gets at the real reason why Nia is in therapy: her attacker is up for parole. But Nia fears giving a victim impact statement at the parole hearing would just result in more pain, shame and humiliation, concluding that she has no interest in stepping back into the 'media circus' and once again becoming the poster child of victimhood.   Dr. Lilith advises Nia that making a victim impact statement could help her to gradually accept the devastating events of her troubled past and move on. But the impact of that night has had far greater consequences than Nia initially disclosed. Dr. Lilith must decide how far she’s willing to push her new patient in order to get at the truth.",

Asam,"Iran, Islamic Republic of",ebad,adibpour,"An alone child without shelter,  consider his teacher's umbrella the best shelter and he tries to achieve it. The cause of the movie: This narrative narrates the story of the late 1970s in Iran. In the villages poverty and lack of access to the city, life was very difficult. The only person who could travel to these villages were teachers, who used motorcycles because of the lack of roads. Children always have great aspirations, but these children could not see any technology, and could not be imagined, because of their lack of communication with the outside world. The umbrella was the only technology that the teacher brought to the village where the children could imagine it in their intellectual world. One child more than anyone else because he was the only man in the family, he loved the umbrella, thinking that all the bitterness would end with the story. At the end of the film, we happily saw the village people who continue to repeat their path, curvature and curvature. One of the reasons for making a film is the depiction of missing children's wishes, which today are faced with an emotional crisis in the family, greed, lack of use of these facilities and the ability to understand the right way of life. Movie conditions: ""Kalatak"" Village, ""Kohgiluyeh and Boyer Ahmad"" Province are among the deprived areas of the country. People in the area often migrated to cities in order to get rid of poverty, deprivation and access to jobs and health. The recorded images are about the pristine nature of this region. All Assam's movie plans were shot at 7 days. All actors were selected from the remaining people in the villages of this region and trained for a month by the director. For example, the role of teacher actor is a simple construction worker who does not have the ability to read and write. The costume design was based on the costumes and handicrafts of the people who had been kept since that time. The bowls depicted in the film are a symbol of the working mothers of the rural area, who played a role in the difficulty of slap times on their faces, but still like a refractory and artistically beautiful beauty in their pristine homes (designing students' bags and curtains designed on Blinds) for generations to come. Roofed wood and rocks on the roof are the symbol of the men of this land that are bent and rotten, but still stubbornly standing over their families like mountains. The umbrella is a symbol of technology that is in the welfare of humans, but children with their own clean hearts are astonished at watching them at night, maybe they will touch it tomorrow in their loneliness. Rain is the symbol of the hand of God, which is a mercy for some people and grief for others. ",

The Epiphany of the White Rabbit,United Kingdom,Katya,Kan,"Epiphany of the White Rabbit is the vision of an epiphany, it eludes to the quest for knowledge, the journey of awakening and the surrender into the unknown. The White Rabbit as a spiritual symbol for the  journey along the path to enlightenment. A quest into ’what is’.  The pre-Socratics, who studied the most obvious thing to them – Nature, wanted to develop the essence of being and explain the changes around them, namely, how things went from being to non-being and to accept all that comes.  Set on location in a vegetable patch and winter gardens. The rabbit encounters an uncomfortable awakening, an intrinsic and deep connection to nature and a shedding of layers, her skin, her inhibitions, her outlook, and her pre-conceptions as a metaphor for change.  The White Rabbit knows there is more to life than the mere cocoon of the ‘self’. The work explores expansion of consciousness, the many selves, the quest for knowledge and portrays the ever changing flux and flow of nature and the elements, fire portrayed as the source. Her lack of shadow represents her lack of ego, a metaphor drawing a line between the conscious and unconscious mind, in terms of shadow, a person who is highly conscious is like a full moon with no dark or shadowy areas.  White, the symbol for purity, forgiveness, peace and a cleansing of the mind.  The Rabbit uses her white skin as a flag, the element of surrender and turns it into a kaleidoscopic wonderland, moving into ultra dimensions.  The work was designed, filmed and visioned by Dianne Harris, starring Katya Kan as her avitar - the White Rabbit. Dancers Isabel Cressy & Laura Cherry are featured. The music is by Vivaldi, Handel, Marty Ratcliff & Dianne Harris. The final work is 15 mins in duration.",

This then filters into everyday conversations, leaving someone who does feel suicidal or has felt suicidal no space to be free from the unwanted and intrusive thoughts that already overwhelm them. The graphic and violent descriptions we use to express ourselves take away from the ability to express suicidal feelings, reducing the impact therefore the acknowledgement. The frequency of these comments will lead and has led to the normalisation of a seriously debilitating mental state. When we say “I’m gonna kill myself” in a jokey context we make it so difficult for someone to say when they actually feel this way.

The South Pole and Global Climate Change,Turkey,Yunus,Topal,"“This frozen world offers us an unknown ritual with unusual seasons, months of night and day. While the mankind is adding new signs to the traces of the past, I wanted to explore this place and understand those who gave their lives for this aim. Now these places back to the night. The temperature will drop even further. The top of the ocean will be covered with ice again. The birth of a new day will be at least six months later. Who knows, maybe I will be there to welcome the sun on another polar morning.” I intend to take you to far places difficult to reach with my work including my journey to the South Pole, one of the most difficult points to reach on Earth where I went to, observed and lived my adventure, took my photographs and produced my documentary. This challenging frozen geography has an impact on our world, our city, even our home, on our tables. What is it? The global warming and climate change. These terms which we have just begun to hear tell us that something important will happen in the near future, what can happen, how can we counteract it, how can we take measures individually and socially? That is exactly why this documentary was shot. We have made a gruelling, spooky journey to the most difficult place in the world for you. We try to make it visible for you who did not see with eyes and heard with ears. Now, let’s all stop for a moment to think, is our future really in danger? The ice you’re watching is melting fast. The world is getting hotter and warmer. Do you remember the last summer when the record temperatures of the last 200 years, the tsunamis, the floods… that’s all you see because the ice melts? As the ice melts, the natural climate of the Earth disappears, causing the climate to change and the earth to heat up. Does this warming affect only living beings on this continent? No, it’s deeply affecting us. I guess it is not too late for everything, we can do something. We will be protecting ourselves while we’re protecting our nature. So what are we going to do? We searched and present for you. That is how the documentary begins to narrate the journey to the frozen continent to create an awareness for global warming and climate change.",

ONE of Those Nights,Hong Kong,Hau Yin,Ku,"In this work, I wanted to recreate an experience a few of my friends and myself encountered lately - panic attack. It can happen randomly and without an apparent cause. We endure physical suffering when there is no real danger, such as shortness of breath, paralysis, headache, and loss of control...etc. We then enter a state where time does not seem to exist and suffering seems endless. By then, we can often experience a distorted feeling of time and space, where senses are sometimes strengthened, for example, being annoyed by a slight amount of sound easily.   These kinds of surreal experiences appeared to be unfamiliar to the general public, or even to ourselves. I believe it somehow uncovers our unconscious mind by releasing physical signals. Therefore, I found it interesting when I tried to present the experience in video form with several symbolic imageries. For instance: a red bucket that represents the intenseness and the closure of space - alienation from the surrounding and self, a hammer and nails that symbolize the feeling of threat, discomfort, and numbness. Other symbols such as rope, water, plastic wrap, and different kinds of sound sources also helped to visualize the unique experience.   Due to the nature of panic attack - alienation from time, space, and self, there is no clear causal relationship, plot, or dimension of time in this video. But only, a sense of distortion, confusion, and chaos.",
Bring the Noise,Brazil,Catarina,De Castro,"The characters in the film show the most genuine human side present in an artist. The glimpses and afflictions that permeate the uncertain daily life searching for where to belong through street music set the tone of the film. The contrast between their different views makes us dive into the delights and contradictions about what success, love, art and life are. The women characters of the film stand out in matters concerning strength and protagonism, while questions about media, politics, feelings and spirituality are subtly placed between one cut and another.  Without leaving humor and spontaneity aside, director Catarina de Castro dives with a loose and almost playful lens into the daily lives of these artists. Without any answers or conclusions, it is up to the spectator to decide how to immerse into the invisible universe of those who make street art a lifestyle.  With the special participation by Badi Assad, an important Brazilian musician who has traveled the world and performed on large stages, the artist experiences for the first time transforming the street into the stage of the day, in an exciting exchange with the public. Among the street artists interviewed and followed during the film are Kacá Novais, Lilian Jardim, Lúcia Zorzi, and the group Teko Porã, whose members are Bia Sabiá, Kinda Assis, Pablo Nomás, Caio Gregory and Israel Marinho.

JOYCE'S DREAM,"Tanzania, United Republic of",Said,Yusuph,"Tanga, Tanzania. The Present. Joyce is an eleven-year-old girl who lives in a village on the plains between the Indian Ocean and the Usambara mountains. Her family are subsistence farmers, eking out a living growing maize and cassava on an arid twenty-acre plot prone to erratic rainfall, floods and famine. She has twin mischievous brothers aged thirteen who work the farm having dropped out of primary school. Joyce, on the other hand, is a brilliant student, good at all subjects and a voracious reader of anything she can get her hands on. She enjoys school very much and dreams of one day becoming a Doctor. Mama Joyce encourages her daughter’s dreams but Baba Joyce, a taciturn patriarch, thinks she’s wasting her time with such lofty ambitions. As far as he is concerned, the best she can hope for is to marry a good man and become a farmer’s wife. One day, an official from the Ministry of Education, Mrs Ruta, arrives at the village to announce that the school is to be closed down due to a lack of resources and the fact that no one has ever passed the primary school exams and gone on to secondary. Joyce is devastated by the news and rushes home to tell her parents. She implores her father to appeal to the authorities but he tells her it’s probably for the best and she should forget about school. Undeterred, Joyce convinces Mrs Ruta to come to her home and tell her father how good a student she is. But the appeal doesn’t move Baba Joyce, who nonetheless takes Mrs. Ruta’s business card. A few months before the end of the academic year, the school is closed down. Joyce spends her days at home bored and disconsolate until she decides one day to embark on a little project. Having read a leaflet on agriculture she obtains from the village shopkeeper, the careful Mangi1, she decides to ask her father to allow her to grow chillies on a small fallow patch of their farm. Baba Joyce (on the urging of his wife) reluctantly agrees and Joyce begins her experiment. But as the crop slowly starts to grow, she grows bored and decides to return to the school she loved so much. Despite it being abandoned, she sneaks into the school grounds and her old classroom when she spends her days reading her textbooks alone. As the day's pass, other pupils return to play on the grounds of their old school. Joyce tries to encourage other kids to learn with her, and a few respond. But they soon grow distracted and revert to playing, leaving Joyce once again as the only child in the village seemingly concerned about education. One day, the crops on the family farm are destroyed by baboons that get onto the land when the Twins neglect their duties to go fishing. Furious, Baba Joyce thrashes his sons, and in a fit of pique, burns Joyce’s books before heading to Mangi’s to get drunk. But instead of sympathy, Mangi has harsh words for his friend, ridiculing him for being such a brute. 1 She gets it from Mangi, who got a bunch of leaflets from a visiting donor consultant and used them to wrap dry goods instead. With no books to occupy her mind, Joyce grows even more disconsolate. But showing great spirit, character and responsibility, she enthusiastically helps out with replanting the crop that was destroyed. Baba Joyce (grudgingly) apologises for his anger, but still shows no faith in his daughter’s chilli patch. Sensing a softening in his attitude, Mama Joyce tries to convince her husband to get their daughter into a school where she can sit her secondary school entrance exams. He refuses, but as a consolation brings her an assortment of leaflets from Mangi and a book on home economics, a subject more befitting a woman. For this small gift, Joyce is very grateful and hugs her surprised father who sees and feels for the first time, what an education means to his daughter. After many dry months, the late rains finally start to fall and fall hard. In the resulting torrents, the maize and cassava crops are either drowned or washed away. Miraculously, the chillies survive. Seeing the state of panic that her father is in, Joyce harvests her crop and gives it to her father so he can take it to the buyers (supported by the donor project who produced the leaflets she has been reading) and earn some money. Much to everyone’s surprise, the chillies are of high quality. As a result, the buyers offer Baba Joyce’s money for seeds and inputs to plant twenty acres on contract as soon as possible. Thus the family is saved from financial ruin. Highly emotional (and a little delusional), Baba Joyce returns home and tells his family the good news, casting himself as the hero of the hour. His wife (and later, Mangi) puts him in his place, reminding him the chillies patch was Joyce’s idea, that she learned from her self education. Baba Joyce knows they are right and resolves to do the right thing. Baba Joyce talks things over with Mangi who tells him he has a diamond in the rough in his daughter. Baba Joyce uses Mangi’s mobile to call Mrs Ruta in Dar es Salaam. Without hesitation, she says she will allow Joyce to sit the secondary entrance exams in a school in Magomeni but they must come immediately. The exams are the following day. An ecstatic Joyce and her father make the bus journey to Dar es Salaam. But after a puncture that keeps them on the road overnight and the wrong daladala connection the next day, they arrive late at the Magomeni School. Baba Joyce convinces the exam officials to allow her to take the exam, even though she will only have half as much time as the other pupils. As Baba Joyce waits outside, pacing the grounds, he finds an office where the invigilators, academic staff and Mrs Ruta wait for the exams to finish. With tears in his eyes, he tells them what a wonderful daughter he has and how he has been foolish in not noticing her academic brilliance earlier. They listen to his appeal but cannot make any special dispensations. She will have to pass the exams to attend secondary school. The exam finishes and the papers are collected and taken to the office. As Joyce and her father make their way to the bus stop to return home, Baba Joyce fears the worst. But before they board, they are intercepted by Mrs Ruta who informs them that Joyce’s paper was truly remarkable and she will be offered a scholarship. Happily, father and daughter make their way back to Tanga.",

All their interaction now takes place between the walls of the family house, and Týna is having a very difficult time coping with her condition. But she rejects any mention of therapies and professional care, she simply wants to be at home with her husband, whom she loves despite the risk that she might end up losing herself.

The Dark Side of the Light,South Africa,Asha,Loon,"My short film, “The Dark Side of the Light” is based on the idea that nothing exists alone - there is an undeniable sense of interconnectedness within every seemingly mundane aspect of our lives. When contemplating how to give this “interconnectedness” a physical form, I felt drawn to the mysterious and intriguing story of the Red String. There are many different interpretations of the red string's meaning according to different cultures. In my film, I chose to focus specifically on the Japanese interpretation of the legend.  According to Japanese mythology, human relations are predestined by an invisible red string tied to each person’s pinky finger that leads them to their final destination - specifically, another person with whom they will make history. The legend states that “the two people connected by this string will have an important story and will impact each other’s lives profoundly, regardless of the time, place, or circumstances.” However, in my film, the red string does not refer to soulmates as such, but rather to the story we knit ourselves with the “string” that was given to us at birth. In a sense, altering our predestined path.  My short film takes an expressive approach to inner transformation. Using red string as a symbol of connection, the film shows a person coming to terms with every side of themselves. My film portrays a person, a universal figure, paging through a red book that contains stories from his past and absorbing the words he reads - in a sense, untangling these memories and re-living them. The Red String is connected to the aspects of his life that hold significance and have impacted him profoundly. By intertwining the thoughts, places, memories, and experiences that have shaped who he is together, he is able to feel at home in his new identity.   The stories he explores inside the Red Book are encapsulated within my poetry, which is read throughout the film as a narration, which is how I view poetry in my life. I see it as a tool to “narrate” my experiences - both painful and joyful - in the way that those experiences would feel in words. Figuring out the way in which you fit into the world is something that every young person grapples with, and I wanted to depict the complexity of this journey in a symbolic way.",https://youtu.be/CvehRLVCZM4

As a result of the accident, Paweł is very seriously injured. There is a head injury, fracture of the spine in the lumbar region and damage to the spinal cord. A few months after the accident, Paweł is sitting on the couch in his dark apartment. Pensive, he opens the letter and takes out a small piece of paper with a dedication on it. ""May this gift of the heart help you to enjoy life to the full again as much as you can."" Next to Paweł, there is a wheelchair tied with a bow. Many months later, Paweł's room is still completely dark. Deliberately obscured curtains, which makes it dark and gloomy. Paweł is in a similar mood. Pawel's mother enters when she sees her dejected son. Paweł is sitting in the donated cart drinking alcohol. The mother, helpless, goes to the window and opens the curtains to let in some light. He tries to persuade Paweł to finally go outside, especially since the summer weather is beautiful. Paweł allows himself to be persuaded and finally drives out of the house in a wheelchair. When he's outside, he drives and looks around. He sees beautiful blooming flowers and butterflies everywhere, but these pleasant moments are interrupted by the screeching of car tires and a whine. When Paweł stops in a wheelchair and turns his head, he sees a car driving away hurriedly and a dog lying on the side of the road. Paweł jumps up and drives very quickly to the bloodied dog. He grabs the phone and calls for help. The dog is placed on the operating table in the veterinary clinic. After the operation, Paweł learns that the operation was successful, but unfortunately, due to the severe injuries the dog suffered, his hind legs will be paralyzed for the rest of his life. Paweł asks the doctor to give the dog to his care. A very sad boy tries to help the dog. He thinks, looks for ideas on the internet. Tired, he makes coffee and goes back to sketching ideas. When Paweł is sitting over coffee, he picks up the mug and notices 2 circles on a piece of paper. She smiles and comes up with a brilliant idea while looking hopefully at the dog. The next day, the boy constructs something. A few days later, with the sun going down, Paweł is sitting in his wheelchair by the lakes. His face is radiant, bathed in the light of the setting sun. Paul looks ahead, pleased. The dog that he took care of after the accident is sitting quietly next to him. He strokes the dog's head, staring at the water and the sunset. He is finally calm because his dog is sitting in a specially constructed cart that supports his paralyzed paws. And also, like Paweł's trolley, it has two wheels. The boy, stroking the dog's head, holds a small piece of paper in his other hand. It is the same letter he received with the donated wheelchair. The boy looks at the piece of paper and smiles at the dog, saying that nothing will stop them now. They both move forward. Paweł is finally happy because he helped the dog, he has a friend and finally found the meaning of life.",

CLONE - The Murder,Australia,Reno R.,Wijaya,"CLONE is a politically anti-communist out view of futurist and contemporary societies conveyed through the medium that is a ""TV DRAMA"". The film represents what the pure ideology of communism is as a whole which is that of equality, however, represents human history’s version of what this ideology has evolved into which has become one of corrupt dictatorship and false ideals being force-fed into the mouths of the common public. The corrupt version of the communist ideology is represented by the CLONES themselves, and the naivety of the common public is represented through the burglars JOHNSON & SMITH who stumble upon this artificial and governmentally [implied or inferred] controlled neighbourhood (inspired by the nuclear bomb testing neighbourhood in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull). The neighbourhood represented in CLONE is also inspired by Lois Lowry’s novel “The Giver” in which society has become a dystopia due to the people’s reckless determination to become a utopia much like in the giver, CLONE represents society's recklessness by showing the downfall of what was artificially created by these humans having the CLONES who inhabit the neighbourhood taking the role of the plethora of occupations and “out-doing” them leading to characters like CLONE “0298” [at the end of the film], who is the cop/agent who tries to capture the burglars, now turned murderers to keep them from spreading the truth about this controlled neighbourhood. The character of JOHNSON specifically represents how the dysfunctional youth when placed in dire situations must act upon sheer tribal human nature and therefore, must kill (which is what JOHNSON ends up doing).",

Still Arriving,United States,frances,lewis,"It started from trying to discern the difference between stagnancy and stillness. The movie is built upon a series of fairly long takes. And with these kinds of long takes, we are able to see things out to the very end - there is this desire born to watch something in its entirety, unbroken by inattention, like the scene in Kiarostami’s Close Up where we watch a green can roll down the street for almost a full minute. In movies with frequent cuts, we often see either the beginning, middle, or end of an action but are not granted the opportunity to see all three stages unfold without intervention. There is a patience and an attention required as these kinds of moments so often are not actions we will stand still to watch in their entirety. At least when watching these instances unfold on a television screen we know it will cut and we are not in charge of deciding when to end or begin a moment, action, or scene. This decision so inherent in life is taken away. As a movie-goer, we have no choice in the matter of ending or beginning a moment, and so we are both inhibited from making a decision and freed from it. In life, of course, one does not watch the wind in a tree unfold for minutes at a time because it often feels useless, or meaningless to do so. However, in cinema, we know there is meaning in that it was chosen for the screen by someone for a reason and so we are somehow freed to watch something like that unfold without worrying about how to grant meaning to what we are looking at. We don’t really have to worry about giving it this meaning, we can just accept that it is vital we watch it through and through. And it is precisely this continuity of watching a moment out through and through that, I hoped to get at. To me, at least, some of the best moments in cinema are the uninterrupted, long-drawn-out moments in home movies when the camera is set down on the counter and accidentally left on, and for a couple of minutes you can only see the tan kitchen counter and hear the kids, probably named like Crystal and Natasha brushing their teeth and the cicadas are rumbling outside and then the goodnights are conjured up and they’re all in bed in a matter of minutes. And you begin to get a little bored, or at least I begin to get a little bored. But then you overhear Aunt Martha who’s been washing dishes all this time and she starts humming to herself Frank Sinatra’s “My Way” and it’s kinda pretty, but then you think you hear something and you listen closely and you start to hear Aunt Martha singing to herself “Natasha didn’t eat all her food once again, what an annoying brat. What an annoying brat, what an annoying brat.” And you’re suddenly glad you stuck around. That’s not to say that the goal is to run around leaving countless camcorders on countless kitchen counters, recording without anyone’s knowledge, but it is to say that the goal is to catch the moments like this that’ll accidentally come at the end of the night and without a recording there would be no proof of them. And we very much need that proof of Aunt Martha calling her niece a brat.",

The plot is built as a fantastic love drama between the main character Pygmalion and an android doll. One of the most all-consuming problems of our world, namely loneliness, is being studied.

The events happening in three different time periods in the film are linked to an accident that happened to the artisans working in the textile factory of a city.  The workers working in the factory,Madan, Jagdish, Brijbhan, Prakash and other shirt makers are migrant labourers.  While Madan is the main artisan of the factory, Brijbhan is respected among all because of his age and being the oldest in the factory.  Jagdish is the father of a girl whose education and future worries him and Vijay is a common man who is intelligent but a little hot-headed.  Prakash is a simple man who is addicted to bidi. Some of the artisans are also teenage boys, in which Dinesh, Ahmed and Kamlesh are prominent.  Some have to leave the village to run the household expenses and some have to raise money for the education of their daughter.  In between all these daily problems of these workers a big problem arises in factory.  Madan also has a friend Mohit who is a daily wage labourer and worked under the village contractor with his co-workers Raju and Daddu.  The film's third time period tells the story of an elderly worker who once worked in Bombay and often shared the incidents that happened to him with those sitting with him at tea stalls.  The events taking place at the same time in these three places are shown in a very clear and beautiful way in the film.  Welcome to this story of those who build and run the world with their blood and sweat. What conclusion will this story reach and what will happen to these labourers?  What is the connection between the events that take place in these three different time periods and what is it that will leave this story to you? Watch ""paani ka Jahaaz""(The  Ship) to know... ",

The Volunteer Archivists,India,Subhashish,Panigrahi,"Srujanika, a volunteer group started by a scientist couple, once led a movement to make science popular among children in Odisha, India. The group must now archive 200 years of decaying printed literature in the Odia language.  In the early 1980s, a small group of science enthusiast volunteers called Srujanika emerged in the Indian state of Odisha, which would soon become a movement. Founded in Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha, by scientist couple Puspashree Pattnaik and Nikhil Mohan Pattnaik, this small group would travel across the state and beyond to make science popular among children. Their effort took science outside the textbooks and groomed a new generation of scholars and learners. Through their work, they extensively studied the printed Odia publications and realised early how fast the old printed works were vanishing. That realisation led to the digital archival initiative in the Odia language—10,000 volumes printed in 200 years were collected, scanned and archived. It resulted in two major online repositories: the Open Access to Odia Books (OaOb) project, hosted at the National Institute of Technology Rourkela, and the Odia Bibhaba, managed by Srujanika. This work includes digitising the monumental 1930-1940 lexicon Purnnachandra Odia Bhashakosha and over 20 dictionaries. This film captures how only a handful of volunteers at Srujanika spearheaded two major movements and created a culture of making science more fun and exploratory through horizontal and peer learning for children.",

Truth Against Distortion: Survivors Speak Out Against Hate ,Canada,Kelly,Hiebert,"Antisemitism. A tempest of hate that has raged throughout history, expressing itself in various forms. It has shown its face countless times and continues to rear its ugly head, persecuting Jewish people for millennia.  Fueled by this tempest, the Holocaust (1933-1945) or Shoah was one of the most harrowing episodes of our world's history. A state-sanctioned horror led by the regime of Hitler's Nazi Germany, it was marked by atrocities that took the lives of 6 million Jews and crushed the lives of countless others.  In today's world, verbal onslaughts, physical attacks, and more recently, scathing social media posts have all contributed to a rise in antisemitism that exhibits shocking parallels with our past. In addition, we are seeing a rising storm of distortion in a world where the boundaries of hate transcend physical borders.  To address this issue, a group of high school students, inspired and led by their history teacher, embarked on a mission of hope. Their goal? To create a student-driven documentary to educate students about the hate in our world, through the voices of Winnipeg Holocaust survivors.  The film that you are about to watch is the culmination of their work. These survivors are the last witnesses to the Shoah, a history that is being warped and fractured with every passing minute. Weaving together the stories of the past, present and future generations, this film is a light in the darkness, a ray of truth in a world filled with distortion.",

It was also recognized as the Asia’s first human dissection. However, Pandit Gutpa faced social ostracism for his pioneering effort. This short film was an effort to discover untold story Pandit Gupta through a perception of an adolescent boy who once failed to answer a question about him. Life and struggle of Pandit Gupta were depicted through this film in very informative and lucid ways. Starting from his childhood to his untimely death – all important incidents and information are judiciously filmed. Thus, we came to know about his childhood, his brilliance in education and research, his professional excellence, his scientific thought and awareness against superstitions and religious blindness. Pandit Gupta was widely acknowledged as the “First Indian dissector of British India” and took the first phenomenal step in the direction of modern medical education. This significant incident was duly celebrated by the British in a militaristic fashion by firing a 26 round gun salute the Calcutta Fort William. Undoubtedly, Pandit Gupta’s single act of dissection has become a symbolic move of western medicine in undivided India.",

Stabragh Silk tree of kings,"Iran, Islamic Republic of",Zahra,Farshid,"Stabragh: Silk tree of kings  Our story begins in a city called Tuz or Taoke in southern Iran. A city from the Elamite era that reached its peak of glory during the Sassanid era 3,500 years later. When the spread of textile knowledge and industry in this ancient city with a legendary tree and a soft, strong and beautiful fabric called peacock fabric or Dibay Tuz, made that city famous in the ancient world of that time. The Achaemenid to Sassanid kings sewed luxurious clothes for themselves with fabrics woven from the fibers of the same tree. The fabrics that were exported on the Silk Road to Europe and its delicacy and unique features have caused it to be mentioned several times in the Qur'an as the garment of heaven. The fame and expansion of this industry caused the formation of Diba Tooz textile factories in several cities during the Sassanid period, and until the early sixth century AH, the people of that time expanded the vast gardens of this ancient tree in the land of ancient Iran by working in this industry. After that, ""Dibai Tuzi"" suddenly disappeared. In ancient Persian poetry, there are few poets who have not dealt with Diba Tuz. As Nasser Khosrow Ghobadiani wrote: Speech like a fine thread, thin and delicate Speech because the thread must be out of the thread and theme And this is the tree that has already attracted the attention of modern textile craftsmen and researchers.",

It’s funny how we are unknowingly so close to death still we never realize it. We all know we are going to die one day for sure but still we’re running after things, we’re trying to live for something; we never lose hope, we are trying to work it all out even when we don’t know what we really want sometimes.  It all concludes to fact that; life is all about hope but death is the reason why hope still exists. So maybe we all are here to just die one day. And, life is just our journey to death.",

tatata,China,Sun,YiYang,"Based on the research, interviews and records of the three conditions of Congenital Insensitivity to Pain, Chondropathy, Marfan syndrome, I made these three personal pseudo-documentary animations. ""He She He"" not only represent the three of them, but also represent all of us who are neglected and need to establish emotional connections around us. I tried to use the body as a common medium for establishing empathy, to achieve the transformation from perceptual empathy to personal cognitive empathy.  I made those sculptural entity image for each animated character to reproduce the physical form of the three types of diseased characters.  At the same time, the animation is visually expressed in a projected manner.  Sculpture works can be used as a medium for people to share their memories of the body, which adds another layer of touch and connection to the animation.  As an animation work that can be physically touched, I hope that through this way audience can further enhance the emotional perception of the three narrators.",

Vulture Surviving For Life,India,Abdul,Shahid,"Eurasian griffon, Himalayan griffon, Cinereous vulture, and an endangered species known as Egyptian vulture are among the species that can be found here. Both the Indian vulture and the Slender-billed vulture saw a 97.4% decline in their populations.  Jorbeer(Bikaner, Rajasthan)  is a vulture protection hold arranged close to the city of Bikaner which is otherwise called The Place that is known for Raptors. However, neither our observations nor our research yielded a single carcass of a vulture, as the majority of the ones that are found here are not poisonous. The Indian government took a significant step by banning it in 2008, which may account for the vulture population's rapid decline. As a result, the vulture population is rapidly declining, and the majority of them are now in danger of extinction. In the state of Assam, it has been reported that a poisoned carcass caused 100 juvenile Himalayan griffon vultures to die while 11 were rescued. Since there are fewer and fewer open dumping sites, more and more birds are flocking to this one from thirty countries around the world. Between 1993 and 2002, the White-rumped vulture population is said to have decreased by 99.7%. The beauty is that, despite feeding on infected carcasses, the acids in their stomach, which are strong enough to kill the pathogen, prevent them from becoming infected. This location is home to a wide variety of raptors, including numerous species of vultures. These birds clean up rotting carcasses, which is important for the ecosystem despite the generally negative attitude of humans.      A vulture is a carrion-scavenger bird of prey. Therefore, more open dumping yards like Jorbeer ought to be established worldwide for improved survival. They will soon go extinct, so it is our responsibility to protect them by providing a better environment in which they can breed and grow more quickly for a stable ecosystem. Vultures die when diclofenac, a common anti-inflammatory drug, is given to livestock. They control the spread of deadly pathogens like rabies, cholera, foot and mouth disease, and anthrax invisibly.  Sadly, however, there are only a few places left in the world like Jorbeer.    Title: Vulture Surviving For Life  Director  Abdul Shahid Asst.

Crocodile Pond,China,Wang,Yanrusi,"The postgraduate student Wang accidentally fell into the crocodile pond, and several citizens disappeared by the pond at the same time. The event continued to make news, and had attracted great attentions from social media. As the online discussion raged on, the truth became more and more intricate. In the end, Wang gave up climbing ashore, turning himself into a crocodile. The film is played on portrait mobile devices, and virtualizes a drowning accident. By imitating the fragmentary and random ways of seeing in people’s daily life with mobile phones, it presents a chaotic Rashomon effect in a pseudo-environment. The animated, fictional and mockumentary-like way of performance gives a self-reference to current we-media short videos, that the truth is twisted through communication, and that everything is true, or nothing is true. The tongue breaks bone, though itself has none. Wang was never hurt by the crocodile, but by the words of people onshore, and eventually became a crocodile that people avoid like the plague. Yet, who is the real cannibal crocodile?",

Is it an absolute good sullied by corruption, or an absolute evil camouflaged by hypocrisy and interest? This is this philosophical paradox that the film analyzes through its protagonists. The twins, Mahdi and Saddam present two typical examples of this problem. The first interprets the role of the peaceful, ambitious young man, despite the various obstacles of life. The second is a bullying stereotype of the evil and rebellious who tries to extend his dominance and tries to impose his authority on the neighborhood cronies and manipulate them in order to achieve his own goals. The film sheds light on each one's daily life, trying through this contrast, to underline the obstacles and the problems which they are exposed in a dramatic framework aimed at soliciting a reflection likely to explain this paradox.",

Day,India,Happy,Kumhar,"This anthology series focuses on the plights of the modern world.  First, meet the insomniac young adults of the new era. While most devote their time to mindless chatter, others lose sleep after becoming slaves to the corporate world. It is the new “normal” for everyone, sitting by the local tea stall, working all night. Soon, a fellow co-worker arrives and catches up with his friend, revealing something that causes all chatter to grow silent—the former had woken up early, finishing the work he was assigned. Save for the judgemental stares from his colleagues, the only other reaction he receives is profanities from a stranger. Next, a man consumes social media content, or, rather, social media consumes the man. A seemingly placid man starts his day in an orderly manner. Displaying symptoms of extreme perfectionism, he conducts his morning routine, grooming himself well. He moves to the kitchen and prepares his breakfast. The man ensures tidiness, remembering to place a napkin around his neck before he digs in. Then, he reveals his breakfast choices: cutouts from newspapers and social media platforms. He sets aside the newspapers and wolfs down the latter. As he indulges himself in the activity, he increasingly loses his composure, leaving few signs of the former perfectionist. In the final segment, a man heads back to his apartment after a tough day at work. Entering the house, he turns the news on the TV and heads to his bedroom to shower. Emerging from the shower, his attention is instantly drawn to his mobile phone. He returns to the living room unclad and lays down on his front, exposing himself to the TV screen. He concentrates on the phone in his hand as people debate over an individual's right to reason and privacy on the screen behind him. ",

Toro,United States,Alia,Zeid,"Once upon a time, there was self-important and obnoxious igneous rock called Toro who lived at the top of the Grand Canyon. His favorite activity was soaking up the sun on a hot summers day. His favorite view of the Canyon was when the stars were out on a clear night.  Every day, Toro would make fun of the rocks at the bottom of the canyon for being inferior because he had the best view in the canyon. Toro would see other rocks with strong friendships from the top of the canyon. They would play tag, dance, and sing songs. Toro wanted to have friends who thought he was cool so he touted himself as superior and amazing. In reality, Toro's displays of arrogance were to cover up his sensitivity about his lack of friends.  Until one day, a tour group spotted a cool-looking tree while Toro made fun of the rocks at the bottom. A family on the tour group wanted to take a picture at the tree, which was Toro’s unique pedestal, and Toro wanted to be a part of it so he climbed to the top of the tree. After the photo, Toro accidentally slipped off the tree and a child spotted him. The child tossed him up and down for a second, making Toro believe he was amazing enough to be valued by a human, until the child threw him off the cliff for fun. In the fall to rock bottom, Toro bounced off the cliff walls and tumbled through weeds. At the bottom, Toro noticed he was chipped, much to his displeasure.  Because of that, Toro met a rock at the bottom of the canyon called Hermit. He demanded Hermit to help him get back up to the top of the canyon. Hermit only agreed after Toro promised to stop degrading the rocks at the bottom.  Because of that, Hermit led Toro to a river, which they need to cross to get back up. Hermit told him to take a long way around but, in his impatience, Toro tried to go his own route. Consequently, Toro slipped off a rock and is swept downstream.  Because of that, Toro gets caught in between some rocks underwater. He cried for help, and in some self-reflection, he apologized to Hermit for not listening. To Toro’s surprise, Hermit saved him from the river. Toro asked why Hermit would do that after the way Toro treated him and Hermit replied ""better a rock with a flaw than a diamond without"" before they continued their journey.  Until finally, Hermit led Toro across a treacherous ravine to reach the top. Hermit slipped but Toro grabbed onto him as they both fell. Toro used his body to block Hermit from the impact of the drop, causing him to chip enough for his geode to shine. Toro was surprised by his heroic actions but Hermit never doubted his good character and thanked him. At first, Toro was embarrassed by his newfound cracks and flaws but Hermit said that Toro shined as beautifully as his geode. They eventually finished their journey and made it to the top, but Toro realized he didn’t want to lose his friend.  And ever since then, Toro went to live with Hermit at the bottom of the canyon. Toro learned that his narcissism prevented him from getting the friendship he desired and that he needed to develop compassion for the rocks he viewed as inferior at the bottom of the canyon.

"IN- JUSTICE ""The 2012 Nirbhaya Gang Rape Case""",India,Yash,Johari,"This is a documentary based on a real event that happened in Delhi in 2012.  The 2012 Delhi gang rape and murder case involved a rape and fatal assault that occurred on 16 December 2012 in Munirka, a neighborhood in South West Delhi. The incident took place when Nirbhaya (a name used to protect the identities of rape victims), a 22-year-old physiotherapy intern, was beaten, gang-raped, and tortured in a private bus in which she was traveling with her male friend. There were six others in the bus, including the driver, all of whom raped the woman and beat her friend. Eleven days after the assault, she was transferred to a hospital in Singapore for emergency treatment but died two days later. The incident generated widespread national and international coverage and was widely condemned, both in India and abroad. Subsequently, public protests against the state and central governments for failing to provide adequate security for women took place in New Delhi, where thousands of protesters clashed with security forces. Since Indian law does not allow the press to publish a rape victim's name, the victim was widely known as Nirbhaya, meaning ""fearless"", and her struggle and death became a symbol of women's resistance to rape around the world.   All the accused were arrested and charged with sexual assault and murder. One of the accused, Ram Singh, died in police custody from possible suicide on 11 March 2013. According to some published reports, the police say Ram Singh hanged himself, but defense lawyers and his family allege he was murdered. The rest of the accused went on trial in a fast-track court; the prosecution finished presenting its evidence on 8 July 2013. The juvenile accused was convicted of rape and murder and given the maximum sentence of three years imprisonment in a reform facility, as per the Juvenile Justice Act. On 10 September 2013, the four remaining adult defendants – Pawan Gupta, Vinay Sharma, Akshay Thakur, and Mukesh Singh (Ram Singh's brother) – were found guilty of rape and murder and three days later were sentenced to death. In the death reference case and hearing appeals on 13 March 2014, Delhi High Court upheld the guilty verdict and the death sentences On 18 December 2019, the Supreme Court of India rejected the final appeals of the condemned perpetrators of the attack.   On 20 March 2020, at 5:30 a.m. IST, The four adult convicts Mukesh Singh, Vinay Sharma, Akshay Thakur, and Pawan Gupta were executed at Tihar Jail. They were hanged on gallows specially designed for four people. According to prison officials, the four convicts refused the offers of the last meal and new clothes prior to the execution. They were blindfolded and did not resist as they were led to the gallows; however, Vinay Sharma suffered a breakdown prior to his execution and began pleading with the guards. The four convicts were pronounced dead after hanging for 30 minutes.  ",

As Cypriots (both Greek-speaking and Turkish-speaking) we have become accustomed to the division of our small island. Despite its rich culture and history, Cyprus, its people, and its history still remain relatively unknown in the international arena - often living in Greece's or Turkey's shadows, due to their historical and political involvement on the island.

Three stories from Gaza,Israel,Mohammed,Khamis,"Three stories from Gaza   A film that monitors aspects of the diary of a besieged city  The film ""Stories from Gaza"" monitors aspects of the events that took place in the 2012 Gaza war during the 8-day Israeli occupation. The film, which is of a short documentary type, tells the story of journalist Emad and the stories he lived and documented as an archive during the war, and how he faced difficulties and dangers during the period. In which he depicted the story of the two children ""Rham"" and ""Nader"" who died as a result of the Israeli bombing of the besieged city.  The film embodies 3 stories that took place in 2012 in the Gaza war. In addition to the story of the photographer Imad Badwan, one of the stories tells about the 8-year-old girl, Reham, who was playing with her companions in front of her family’s house. In Gaza, half an hour after Reham was martyred, a child named Nader was martyred while he was going to get food for his seven brothers after they had been without food for three days. He was hit by a missile strike in front of the grocery store.   He contacted this journalist to agree on the completion of a film that tells of his stories that he documented during the Gaza war, but the completion of the film was delayed until 2020, and it was an opportunity, he says, to document the changes and transformations that took place during the eight years.  The young director pointed out that his film ""Stories from Gaza"", which is a joint work between Sweden and Palestine, Gaza, is a rather strange documentaries in terms of handling and photography.  The director, who lives in Sweden, revealed that journalist Badwan was working on a TV channel and documenting what he saw and experienced, and in the year 2020, he was asked - as he says - to visit the father of the child who was martyred while he was going to secure food for his siblings and find out the family's situation and what happened with them during the years following the child's death He found that Abu Nader had given birth to another child, named after his martyred child, and his living conditions had improved. He explained to the journalist that he had tried to communicate with some institutions and humanitarian organizations to help him and demand the right of his son, but to no avail. The film was exposed to many dangers while documenting the events. One day, a shell fell near it and was hit by shrapnel. He was taken to the hospital. Later, it was filmed playing with the children of Gaza in the streets and alleys to create an atmosphere of optimism and hope in the conditions of war, especially that we are accustomed - as he says - to films It begins with the war and ends without a window of hope, so I want the film to summarize the 8 years that Gaza lived in, in addition to the journalist’s biography and how it developed later.  The state of chaos in the city and the lives of its people and the life of journalist Imad Badwan as he faced difficulties and dangers, and this journalist had no way to show his archive, which he photographed during the years of siege and war.

Two Minus One,India,Tanishka,Mehtani,"Two Minus One is the story of that Indian woman. Yes, the one whose broken marriage becomes a hushed discussion every now and then. The one whose children you eye with pity. The one who’s a whole person on paper, but is expected to go on like half an entity.  Often, conversations about Indian culture valorise the togetherness of the Indian family unit. They glamorise the quintessential big, fat and colourful Indian weddings. At the same time, ‘bad’ marriages are quietly accepted as collateral damage. The path to marriage is made clear to millions of women since their childhood. But the way out is rarely discussed.   The way our collective consciousness has accepted this dichotomy as ordinary is unsettling, to say the least. This film is as much a heartwarming story of courage, as it is a question mark on the institution of marriage, ideas of love and feminism in India. It is also a step in the direction of recognising much needed support systems that are developing beyond popular discourse.   This short documentary is our humble attempt to share, celebrate and reflect on the life of Neeti, a woman who thought her life had fallen apart as she navigated an abusive marriage. Little did she think that one day she’ll have the courage to call it quits, and demand a new lease on life. ",

Kiss of Land,Sweden,Waldemar,Masicz,"Urbanization processes have led to the concentration of people in cities. Modern cultural practices emerged in the cities. The contemporary art scene is concentrated in the cities.  But the city is a territory of limited existence of individuality. Existence in the city is reduced to emasculated processes of eating food, going to work, and performing a limited list of body movements necessary to maintain life, but at the same time empty in its content and visual expression.  Such a way of life in the city, typical for most citizens, creates a state of sensory deprivation in a person, discoloration of feelings and loss of contact with oneself and reality.  The key descriptive concept of typical cities built in the 20th century is an ordered stone bag in which the same artificial sounds and the same faded looks are reflected from concrete and glass. An artist, locked in ordinary typical box, is in fact doomed to hallucinate in this internal combustion chamber.    Can we return from the city to the land? Can we rediscover the land? Can we take a kiss of land?",

Surviving paycheck to paycheck and doing mundane jobs, after the crash he rewrote his life and started his transformative journey from regular joe to a rising country music star. He opened shows for some of the biggest artists in the world and toured globally to play for American & International soldiers at military bases in Iraq, Afghanistan and more. Brian knew how to let loose too, customizing a tour bus, shooting machine guns out of the back of helicopters and even sleeping in Saddam Hussein’s palace. With eight years of documented videos on tour featuring daily updates from Brian telling his story in real-time, there seemed to be nothing that could ruin his trajectory.   Then, when back-to-back family tragedies struck, a devastated Brian stepped away from it all at the apex of his career– stopping it dead in the water.    A documentary over 10 years in the making will soon inspire millions to wake up like Brian did and pursue dreams of their own.

Buddhist Allegory,China,Zhi,Hua,"This work was created in 2022 and lasted nearly a year. It is a series of works composed of three different units. The original intention of the work is to uphold empirical experience and statistical data, and to realize the presentation of video works in real scenes using real materials, so every detail is based on the premise of scientific demonstration. It takes rational analysis to the extreme. Part 1 Fo Zao Xiang: Buddhas are also called Buddha statues, which are created by people who feel the Buddha.The two identical statues, back to back and invisible to each other, invisible but touchable, can be imaged through the screen in front of them.The screen is fixed, and the two Buddhas rotate and shift their positions at the bottom. In the continuous cycle of reincarnation, it is difficult to tell whether they are themselves or others in the mirror, nor distinguish between reality and illusion. In the latter part of the work, the Buddha statue on the screen is a directional alienation instead of a real presentation.The illusion is no longer a simple self-image of the Buddha statue, but the awakening of the illusion's self-awareness and the beginning of changing the physical trajectory as the main body. With the movement and rotation of the physical Buddha statue, the camera just moved to the position of the physical Buddha's sky eye (one of the five eyes in Buddhism, can see through the six realms, far and near, up and down, front and back, inside and outside, and the future)which indicates that the sky eye has been opened and the future is in the visual expansion and infinity. At the same time, the image on the screen also opens its eyes, and the sound of the heartbeat is gradually heard. The illusion creates its own life and extension in the continuous attempt.  The Buddha said: ""Everything is an illusion"", and when it is difficult to distinguish the self from the body, and the illusion can also come true, we will see the infinite possibilities of the future. Buddha is the creation of man, and man is the origin of Buddha. When man is creating the real world, there is an infinite metaverse that can be reconstructed and formed. On the one hand, it expresses the emphasis on the visual world, on the other hand, it highlights the prospect of the potential virtual world.  Part 2 Fo Suo Yu: Sitting, lying, standing and walking are all practices, from which one can realize the realm of Zen. A flower has a world of flowers, a leaf has wisdom of a leaf, and the cycle of seasons is the law of nature. Get rid of the obsession in your heart and follow nature. The way to be happy is to be at ease in the present moment. A mottled Buddha statue,which seems to have come from ancient times, with earphones with a sense of age, as if traveling through time and space, we can't tell which is this life and which is the afterlife. The third eye of the Buddha statue in the work has been opened (actually the third eye is a camera), People say: Buddha can open the eyes of the sky and foresee the future. What this Buddha sees is contemporary people. By wearing earphones (the earphones emit the same sound as the Buddha) and watching the screen (The content displayed on the screen is captured by the camera.), it seems that they share the same language and vision with the Buddha. With a body with a long history, the Buddha is based on the present and has insight into the future. This Buddha is the Buddha of the past, and what this Buddha foresees is the future. In the concept of time, the past, the present and the future are a chaotic whole,with a cycle going on and on, and difficult to distinguish. Time and space are indistinct,and things are like a speck of dust in the huge universe. Therefore, we need to treat our surroundings with a broad and inclusive mindset, to stabilize ourselves, and to achieve the unity of heaven and human beings. The past, present, and future are boundless at first. Human beings keep memories of the past, and long for prophets in the future. Humans and Buddhas appear in the same field, time and space are condensed in the present, and the domain is infinite.  Part 3 Fo Huan Yu: A huge inflatable plastic bag wraps the entire body of the Buddha , which breathes continuously. According to some scientific evidence, since the inhaled gas is more than the exhaled, the plastic bag will become smaller and smaller until it is all absorbed on face.As a result, the breathing becomes more and more rapid. At the same time, several Buddha statues will experience the same. Collective unconscious cluttered sounds gradually transformed into the same-frequency resonance to make the most powerful call, and finally the breathing sounds gradually disappeared. In the past few years when the coronavirus is raging, the virus has gradually shifted from being sporadic, local, and few at the beginning to being multi-faceted and large in number. It is becoming more and more precious for humans to be able to breathe, or breathe healthily. Paying attention to the individual and listening to the voice of the group enables us to manage situation well in the early stages , take preventive measures , pay attention to the community of life and the common destiny of mankind.

The three worlds are connected by a continuing narrative structure that builds on each other and is carried by the music and the sound design as artistic elements. Tension, overload, letting go and coming home are the keywords that determine the pacing of our social spot Doubts.  Everyone is invited to draw more strength from themselves and reflect on it. Realize that you are not alone with these doubting thoughts. Each of us struggles with ourselves. Even success does not allow us to defeat the doubts. They are barely noticeable from the outside, even if they are screaming inside. But it is up to us how much attention we pay to these voices in our head. To question the external and internal expectations and allow overload and chaos to move aside for calm and clarity.  The quote at the end finishes the film with a critique of our society which profits from our self doubts and encourages us to set out on the path to more self-acceptance.  ",

This has created a certain tension and expectation as to whether 2020 is the year in which society will rise up, a tension that we, too, could not escape. But then came Corona and the global lockdown. The Corona virus brought the world to a standstill. This is exactly where the film begins with a striking before-and-after comparison, or in other words: from rise up to ""resurrection"".   The 2020 Rise up is a film project that was created by the effects of the initial restrictions and deals with them directly. How can one be politically active in one's own four walls? How do you mobilize the population if you cannot be active in public space? Various groupings have found ways and means and have not remained silent despite the standstill. ",

Lan Dianyao called ""zaisei"", and it is one of the most important rituals in Lan Dianyao's life. It is to make Lan Dianyao youth into a qualified and complete Lan Dianyao male. The author believes that Lan Dian Yao’s ritual not only has the characteristics of adult ceremony, but also a tool of Lan Dian Yao ethnic identity. It is the foundation of Lan Dian Yao’s religious activities and the core religious ceremony in Lan Dian Yao’s social culture. An orderly life becomes possible. The ritual of salvation is closely related to the social life of the Lan Dianyao. The salvation ceremony is the result of the continuous creation of religion, culture, system and social process by the Lan Dianyao in the overall social environment.         Under the impact of random urbanization, a large number of young and middle-aged Lan Dianyao men go out to work in order to live their lives. They also like some fashionable elements. However, the village is always their final place of belonging. Land settled and lived, the wandering and nomadic Lan Dianyao combined ritual and religion to form a ritual of salvation.         Sometimes, can Mandarin really replace the emotional effects of national languages? Sometimes, the staggered heights of brick houses can really replace the ethnic memories of the smooth and flat wooden houses? Sometimes, the man, the mountain and the dog, really can't resist the mechanical temptation of reinforced concrete?",

My reimagining of the original film follows two perspectives.   The external perspective captures the way a human functions — a documentation of his daily routine from the point of view of 'the others'.   The internal perspective depicts the way a typical male and female function in our South-Asian society. The mundane acts carried by both the genders in a certain way; subtly hint towards their conditioned behaviour which each of them, at times, struggle with internally. ",

Attitude,Gambia,MaximillianGroup,Inc,"""Attitude"" is a powerful and thought-provoking piece of spoken word poetry. The speaker seems to be struggling with a sense of powerlessness and lack of control. They feel like they have no rights and that they are at the mercy of others. However, they are also determined to stand up for themselves and to not be taken advantage of. The poem is a reminder that we all have the power to choose our attitude, even in the face of adversity.  I think the poem is also a commentary on the nature of power. The speaker seems to be saying that power is not always about who has the most money or the most resources. It is also about who has the most attitude. The speaker is determined to show that they have the attitude to stand up for themselves and to not be taken advantage of.  Overall, ""Attitude"" is a powerful and thought-provoking poem that speaks to the importance of attitude. It is a reminder that we all have the power to choose our attitude, even in the face of adversity.  ABOUT OBAFA ONEMA  Obafa Onema is a young Gambian who is seeking to understand and navigate the opportunities, rights, politics, and the life he is faced with. His spoken word pieces are a powerful perspective on life in the Gambia, West Africa.  Obafa grew up in Busumbala, the Gambia, with his mother and eight siblings. When he was 15 years old, his father was killed in the war, leaving Obafa, the eldest male, as the head of the household. To provide for his family, he was forced to quit high school and get a job, ending his dream of becoming a medical doctor. Reading became his passion, and he writes continuously. Today, he works in construction as a day laborer. He is 24 years old.  Obafa is a talented and insightful writer. His spoken word pieces are both personal and political, and they offer a unique perspective on the challenges and opportunities of life in the Gambia. He is a powerful voice for change, and his work is an important contribution to the conversation about the future of the Gambia.  About Muhammed Dibbasey, Poet  Through his spoken word poetry, Dibbasey depicts a young man's struggles with failure, opportunity, and success in Gambia. His four poems, titled Sleepless Nights, They Say, Attitude, and I Like Words, express hope, frustration, and the impacts of Gambia's history of the slave trade and colonialism.   Dibbasey's story identical to that of Obafa Onema. A story of perseverance and self-made success. Growing up in Busumbala, one of Gambia's poorest neighborhoods, Dibbasey became the family's eldest male after his father died fighting in the war when he was only 15 years old. He abandoned his dream of becoming a doctor to support his mother and eight siblings, most of whom were orphans whose parents were killed in the same war as Dibbasey's father. Despite these challenges, he never lost hope and eventually started a record label and talent management agency, Cellular Vibrations, representing some of the top hip-hop, afrobeat, and afropop performers in the Gambia.  ""OBAFA"" is a brilliant reflection of Dibbasey's journey and the struggles he has faced. His works have received acclaim from artists and audiences alike, with some describing it as ""a mind-blowing reflection of a dream of opportunity,"" and ""an exciting reflection of the past of a young man navigating the present"", says Max Barrett, Editor of OBAFA.

The diegetic world of the film is a reflection of Iranian society. It has perpetually produced human waste, especially in the young generation. Abandoned youngsters are struggling to create a future for themselves. Behzad is a disillusioned man who carries the heavy weight of an overwhelming futureless job. Ali, the still illusioned one, waits jobless and tries to postpone the determination to be crushed by a dead-end job later. The bravest among the three is Maryam, a girl who has consciously rejected the current order. She has decided to live a vagabond life with no particular destination. Ali has a routine of wandering around the town and killing time. Then he usually joins Behzad at his workplace. When Behzad finishes working, they walk together to Behzad's apartment.

Bunmi tries the best she can to help mummy Kike by being a mentor, a mother, a friend, and a professional adviser to her just so she can finally take a stand and look out for the good of herself and not the Society by getting a Divorce. But like many married women in the Nigerian Society, mummy kike (Gbemisola) is constricted in the box of “what will they say/think”. That’s right, what will her family think of her, what will her fellow women who go through the same agony, and still manage to go on regardless, think of her, and most importantly, what will the Church think of her. Bunmi manages to convince Gbemisola all the same and instructs her to make a final blow by explaining to her (mummy Kike) Pastor, why the divorce is needed. mummy Kike makes a fine argument but the Pastor doesn't see to Gbemisola’s reason and unfortunately disapproves of the idea of a divorce due to its contrast with the ideals/doctrines of their religion. Following this disapproval, mummy kike prioritizes the Pastor’s words ahead of Bunmi’s by deciding to go on with the marriage believing her husband will inevitably change over time, and dismissing the unwanted weed in her marriage farm, in other words ending her friendship with Bunmi. Unfortunately, another usual “quarrel” over a petty situation springs up between Gbemisola and her husband, which leads to the usual “him beating her mercilessly” which somehow ends with an unusual situation of “her stabbing him to death” in a bid to defend herself but of-course is viewed by the public/law as murder. This leads to mummy kike’s incarceration and the ignition of Bunmi’s traumatic experience.",

I like Words,Gambia,MaximillianGroup,Inc,"""I Like Words"" is a beautiful and powerful expression of the love of words. It is a reminder of the importance of words and their power to shape our lives.  Spoken Word of Obama Onema was released on the self-titled album ""OBAFA"".   ABOUT OBAFA ONEMA  Obafa Onema is a young Gambian who is seeking to understand and navigate the opportunities, rights, politics, and the life he is faced with. His spoken word pieces are a powerful perspective on life in the Gambia, West Africa.  Obafa grew up in Busumbala, the Gambia, with his mother and eight siblings. When he was 15 years old, his father was killed in the war, leaving Obafa, the eldest male, as the head of the household. To provide for his family, he was forced to quit high school and get a job, ending his dream of becoming a medical doctor. Reading became his passion, and he writes continuously. Today, he works in construction as a day laborer. He is 24 years old.  Obafa is a talented and insightful writer. His spoken word pieces are both personal and political, and they offer a unique perspective on the challenges and opportunities of life in the Gambia. He is a powerful voice for change, and his work is an important contribution to the conversation about the future of the Gambia.  About Muhammed Dibbasey, Poet  Through his spoken word poetry, Dibbasey depicts a young man's struggles with failure, opportunity, and success in Gambia. His four poems, titled Sleepless Nights, They Say, Attitude, and I Like Words, express hope, frustration, and the impacts of Gambia's history of the slave trade and colonialism.   Dibbasey's story identical to that of Obafa Onema. A story of perseverance and self-made success. Growing up in Busumbala, one of Gambia's poorest neighborhoods, Dibbasey became the family's eldest male after his father died fighting in the war when he was only 15 years old. He abandoned his dream of becoming a doctor to support his mother and eight siblings, most of whom were orphans whose parents were killed in the same war as Dibbasey's father. Despite these challenges, he never lost hope and eventually started a record label and talent management agency, Cellular Vibrations, representing some of the top hip-hop, afrobeat, and afropop performers in the Gambia.  ""OBAFA"" is a brilliant reflection of Dibbasey's journey and the struggles he has faced. His works have received acclaim from artists and audiences alike, with some describing it as ""a mind-blowing reflection of a dream of opportunity,"" and ""an exciting reflection of the past of a young man navigating the present"", says Max Barrett, Editor of OBAFA.

WHILE TRUE,Italy,Davide,Misiano,"Three floors of a school. Two young students walk down stairs, corridors and classrooms, but seem to move outside any real space-time dimension. A boy descends the stairs. A girl walks up them. On each floor they meet and collide, as if they were constantly searching for the key to themselves and their relationship. They are engulfed in a loop, which confronts them with the turmoil of their own hearts.  While true is the short-circuit of consciousness searching for itself and discovering that identity is an illusion, discovering that relationships with others are marked by an unresolvable incommunicability.  While true is a journey into the self-deceptions of the mind, where dissonant melodies resonate. There are so many things we tell ourselves in order to acquire a unitary and coherent image of what we are or what we live, there are so many perspectives with which we could observe the events that affect us, there are so many schemes and masks we impose on ourselves. It is in the choice of the path to follow that we get stuck: thus we take on awareness and destroy it again and again; we believe we have gained clarity and we are faced with our repeated mistakes. The two boys become spectators of themselves, of their lives, of the tangle from which their choices originate, while musical instruments out of every orchestra comment on the cracks that are produced on every plane of their souls. And they discover that the mind is a cage from which they risk not getting out.",

Waiting on the porch with thoughts, the Father smokes a cigarette, staring at the Son when he opens the front door and walks straight in. Profound silence fills the house. The Son puts on his headphones and quietly enters his bedroom, while the heavy-hearted Father goes back to the living room, drinks a few beer cans, and sings karaoke all alone in the dead of night.  The karaoke music accordingly echoes to the upper room, where the Son, now wearing a white brief, looks at himself in the mirror and touches his body with curiosity. Then, he does push-ups continuously until his heavy breaths and the distant clicking sounds of cicadas intermingle and become louder.

Lacuna,Ireland,Simona,Vaitkeviciute,"Lacuna  An empty space, gap or a hole where something should be.  ‘Lacuna’, the animated short is a visual metaphor for what goes on inside the mind of a creative person. The artist chases the fragments of the daydream, within the daydream itself, until ultimately as a result, a creative project of some kind is molded. The film communicates that dreaming is necessary for a creative person, regardless of society’s abstract understanding of this term. Daydreaming is often discouraged in traditional classrooms and work environments. In the field of psychology daydreaming is usually an indication of a possible mental illness, such as suffering from concentration difficulty, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Therefore, ‘Lacuna’ aims to communicate that dreaming is crucial for training one’s creativity and imagination, and for people who often do, ‘Lacuna’ pursues to make them feel less weird about it, and possibly guide them to embrace this quality.  Despite the repelling truth of the term, ‘Lacuna’ portrays the beauty of that bare moment of escape. While having such adept imagination can isolate a person from standard society, the movie wishes to confirm that compatible individuals will accept the ‘dreamer’ for who they are and appreciate them for their unique qualities and view of the world.   “All grown-ups were once children... but only few of them remember it.”- Antoine de SaintExupéry, The Little Prince",https://vimeo.com/826562688?share=copy
